      "because what happens in practice is that people who have a lot of money and by themselves a really good education and therefore continue having a lot of money whereas people who don't have very much money and they learn how to read and write and therefore never make a lot of money and this is especially true in poor countries\n",

      "now because of all of us\n",
      "about ten years ago i decided i wanted to do something that would give equal access to education to everyone\n",

      "at the time i was a professor of computer science at carnegie mellon university and i decided to work on this with my phd student summary\n",
      "the way my brain works olive education is just too general have a problem\n",
      "so i decided let's start teaching one thing and then i started thinking okay well what should we teach first to teach math mean we both loved math me and my cofounder we both have math and now we we didn't decide to do math then we fighting and well maybe you should teach computer science\n",
      "but eventually and this may be surprising that people in north america eventually we decided that the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages\n",
      "and let me tell you why is a number of reasons i'm one of them is that there's a huge audience for it is a two billion people in the world earning a foreign language of in school and outside of schools most of these people went away i learning english about eighty percent of them are learning english and this weird map i hear all the countries in green a countries in which people are pretty\n",
      "dominantly learning english and the reason for that is because english control the transform your life in most countries in the world knowledge of english and significantly increase your income potential\n",
      "so this is another reason why we decided to start with foreign languages and is because you can directly make more money if you'll learn another language in particular english and see this is pretty different than many other subjects for example big math\n",
      "because of math just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to them become a civil engineer like that's how you make more money whereas with languages if you are a waiter and you'll learn english now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money\n",
      "so we decided well let's get started teaching languages now we also convinced ourselves that the only way to really reach a lot of people west are using a mobile phone or smartphone in particular\n",
      "the building schools all over the world is simply too expensive\n",
      "on the other hand most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone and the trend is that a fraction is only going to increase so we decided that the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone and then we call it duolingo\n",
      "now in order to truly be accessible to everyone rich and poor duolingo used as a freemium model to support itself\n",
      "that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay\n",
      "but if you don't pay you may have to see an ad at the end of a lesson\n",
      "and if you don't like ads you can also paid to describe the turn of the ads\n",
      "and it turns out that the vast majority of the revenue for duolingo comes from people to pay described to turn of the ass\n",
      "and now for these people who pay to suspend the turn of the as well they're usually people that well off people in rich countries like the us and canada who are the people who don't pay does as by be usually come from poorer countries like brazil or vietnam or one ammo\n",
      "what i like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically a rich people to pay for the occasion education of everyone so i like that\n",
      "it's a great so with smartphones we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people to pay for the whole thing spread however if you're trying to deliver education with a smartphone you run into a humongous problem\n",
      "and it is that smartphones comic but with some of the most i forgive drugs to humanity has engineered it doctor instagram mobile games\n",
      "seat delivering education of our smartphone is like hoping that people will eat your broccoli or right next to it you put the most delicious dessert ever made\n",
      "if if you really want to deliver education to everyone not only do you have to make it accessible but also you have to make it so that people want to actually learn\n",
      "and we do willing we've been able to do this and at the highest level the where we've done this is by making the broccoli there's like desert\n",
      "i say it another way what we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that\n",
      "apps like instagram up or mobile games used to keep people engaged in this case we use them to keep you engaged with education\n",
      "and even some examples of these techniques one of the most powerful ones is the notion of a streak what a streak is is is just a counter measures a number of days that you've used the proud of consecutive you just think that number you put a very prominently in your product and then people come back every day and the reason people come back every day is because\n",
      "well if they don't come back that number reset to zero and people don't want to lose district\n",
      "it works\n",
      "now on the one side streets have been criticised for for example getting teens addicted to snap chat but in the case of an educational map\n",
      "three get people to come back to study everyday\n",
      "not to give you an idea of the power of streaks in the case of duolingo we have over three million daily active users and have a streak longer than three hundred and sixty five\n",
      "that means they haven't missed the day in the last year or longer now on fact about streaks one country to getting has the longest average streets\n",
      "for an educational app\n",
      "it's pam\n",
      "of course\n",
      "shortest that restricts\n",
      "latin america maybe\n",
      "oh what fun a were fun\n",
      "another important mechanism to get people to come back to your product or notifications on the ones i notifications can be released on the and annoying but in the case of an educational product you will actually want to be reminded to learn and because of duolingo we have a very sophisticated ai system\n",
      "that basically choose this when to send the notification and also what to say in his notification to maximize the probability that people come back\n",
      "now interestingly even after all the sophistication it turns out that the algorithm for choosing what i'm to send your notification is pretty simple\n",
      "you know what is the best time to send people a notification i'll tell you it's twenty four hours after they use the brought up last\n",
      "because and there's an easy explanation if you are free yesterday at three pm you probably street today after be i'm as well\n",
      "and so this is what a very sophisticated millions of dollars of a i found\n",
      "funny\n",
      "now with notifications you shouldn't be spam and we're not spamming with duolingo actually stop sending notifications after seven days of and activities of you don't use duolingo for seven days we stopped and the you notifications not some point it occurred to us if we're stopping the send people don't have a good as we should let them know so i we started sending this notification two people saying it is a reminder\n",
      "seem to be working with stop sending them for now you know people do when they get this notification\n",
      "they come back\n",
      "passive aggressive\n",
      "worst for my mother works for developing a\n",
      "passive aggressive not i guess it's a really good up getting people to come back because they feel like are green our mascot has given up on them\n",
      "so they come back and speaking of a green our mascot by the way because all our notifications come from our green our mascot and well his passive aggressive and also pretty bushy this is given rise to a lot of names on the internet that make fun of just the great lengths that he will go through get you back to learn a language is one of my favorite ones this is it's a meme my favorite ones\n",
      "basically looks like you forgot your spanish lessons and then there's an intruder lend presumably the al broke into your house to give you learn language\n",
      "now duolingo has entered the decide guest and this this thousands of means there's some else gets about it and it's because we've managed to get people to want to learn a language by using the same techniques that\n",
      "mobile games and social media use to get people engaged and\n",
      "this is a really important point let me say this am\n",
      "i don't actually believe that there's a way to make an educational app yes engaging something like picked up where instagram or mobile games\n",
      "but the good news is that and by the way to the reason i don't believe that is because ultimately you have to teach people something and it's hard to compete with like cats and celebrities i'm but the good news is the i don't think you have to so here's the thing when you're learning something you get meaning out of it whereas when you're scrolling for two hours and instagram a lot of times afterwards if\n",
      "you're lucky you just wasted your time so i think it's actually okay if your educational product is only eighty or ninety percent as engaging or something like ticked off because the other ten or twenty percent will be provided by people's internal motivational though of course not much more than that\n",
      "this is really a key point if we want to get people to do something\n",
      "meaningful you can use the same techniques that apps like social media use to get people to do it and even if you're not as engaging as those apps are you can still get hundreds of millions of people to use your product in the case of duolingo for example there are more people learning languages on duolingo in the united states and there are people learning languages across all us high school\n",

      "of this distraction it's not that were distracted it's that our brains are over stimulated it's that we crave distraction in the first place our brains love these tiny little nugget serve information and social media an email and these things that we do of course\n",

      "search you know there was an app that was built for people who wanted to search things that was eaten took the saudis more easily the serve found and then in the era of social graphs it was about connecting people enough followers not what we have done is that we are based on ah machine learning algorithms were showing people what they like and what this means is\n",

      "she you know for the longest time didn't even speak in any of his videos but what he did was in the had talent he was funny he had a good expression he had creativity so we kept posting and today he has one hundred and sixty million followers on our platform so every single day we hear stories like that in a businesses people with talent and i think\n",

      "basically what this is his math in of course you know ai and machine learning has allowed this to be done at a very very big skill and what we have seen the result of this is that he learns the interest signals that people exhibit very quickly and shows you content is really relevant for you\n",
      "in a very in in a very quick way not so it's for it's a form of collaborative filtering from what you're saying that yes the theory behind it is the is humans a weird people we don't really know there's them but if if we see that one human is interested with an overlap of someone else chances are you know you can you can make use of the other pieces that are in that overlap\n",
      "humans repertoire to to to feed feed them and they'll be surprised but the reason they like it is because their power also like that it's his pattern recognition based on your interest signals and i think the other thing here is that we don't actually ask you twenty questions on whether you like a piece of content you know what are your interest we don't do that we\n",

      "i mean lots of\n",
      "startups have tried to use these these types of techniques i'm wondering what else played a role early on him and how how big a deal was a the from the get go you optimizing for smartphones so the videos was shot in for correct format and and they and they were short was that it was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered i think we would have first the really tried\n",
      "this scale you know the recommendation algorithm is a very important reason as to why the the perform is so popular occur among so many people are beyond that you mention\n",
      "the format of itself so we talked about the vision of the company which has to have a window to discover in if you sort of just up for the first time you see to it takes up your screen so does the window that we want you can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their lives then you know through this recommendation algorithm we have found it\n",
      "it connects people together people find communities and i've heard so many stories of people were found their communities because of the contended a posting now give you an example of\n",
      "i was in dc recently and i met with a bunch of creators i heard\n",
      "and so one of them are sitting next to me at a dinner his name is samuel he was a restaurant in phoenix arizona and is a taco restaurant he told me he's never done this before first you know venture\n",
      "she started posting on this content on tick tock end up you know i saw his content in looks of i was hungry after looking at it's is great you know content in his generators so much interest in his business the last year he mean something like a million dollars in revenue\n",
      "just via tick tock one restaurant and in again and again a huge his stories by connecting people together by giving people the window to discover we have forgiven many small businesses and many people your common person a voice that it would never otherwise have and i think that's the power of the platform\n",
      "so you definitely have identified early just how in our social creatures we need affirmation i'm i've had a story and you can tell me whether true or not the one of the keys to your early lift off was that you want to persuade creators who are trying out tick tock that this was a platform where you know they would get whisper\n",

      "just a myth i would\n",
      "i would i would describe it in a different way so the other platforms to exist they don't with before tick tock in if you think about this platforms you sort of have to be famous already in order to go followers because the we is build is that people come and follow people and if we don't if you aren't really famous the chances that you get discovered a very\n",
      "every law now what we have done again because of the difference in the we were recommended content is that we have given any one any single person with enough talent a speech to be able to be discovered in i think that actually is the single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform and again and again you will hear stories\n",
      "from people who use the platform or post regularly on it that if the have something you want to see the performed just them the chance and the stage to connect with the audience in a way that i think no other products in the past as ever offered them\n",
      "so i'm i'm just trying to play back what what use what you said they you said you were describing their differ way what i what i said is is it that in the case that like to give someone a decent chance someone who's brilliant but doesn't come with any follow as initially that you you have you got some technique to identify talent and that you will you will almost encourage them you will you will give them some guy\n",
      "and of from artificially increase the number of followers were like so whatever that they have so the others are encouraged to go wow there's something there and so forth like it's this idea of critical mass that kind of every entrepreneur every party planner kind of those about of the know this is the hot place in town everyone calm and that that is how you actually game critical mass we we wanted\n",
      "sure that every person who posts a video is given and an equal chance to be able to have some audience to begin with but this idea that you are the media alluding to that we can get people to like something it doesn't really work like that you don't then you get could you get a i agents to like something for you see the network way\n",
      "with extra and for could kind of get you know give give someone early encouragement ultimately what the machine does is he recognizes people's interests so if you post something that's not interesting though a lot of people even if you gave it a lot of exposure you're not going to get of morality that you what whereas come so is is a lot of you know there's no\n",

      "they tell you about some of the most joyful and treasured memories of their lives\n",

      "and want to give you all some suggestions for things you can do starting right now to experience it's power for yourself\n",
      "so the first thing we need to start with i am is the fact that fun is a feeling and it's not an activity and it's important because a lotta times when i ask people what's fun though respond with a list of activities that they enjoyed you know the same dancing is fun or scheme as finer i don't know pickle ball is fine\n",
      "everyone seems to think that pickle ball is fun\n",
      "and assure people can be fun but we've all had experiences were something's off and an activity that seems like it would be fun doesn't end up feeling fun\n",
      "and then on the flipside we've had experiences were something that doesn't seem like would be fun at all and the feeling ridiculously fun is an element of serendipity it when people do have fun when they experienced this feeling it's actually very easy to recognize because people who are having fun look like they're being illuminated from within\n",
      "so for example here's me and my husband having fun together\n",
      "here's some president's having fun together\n",
      "here's archbishop desmond tutu and the dalai lama having fun together\n",
      "actually those to seem like they were very often even constantly\n",
      "having fun together\n",
      "and as you can see in these photographs true fun produces this visceral sense of lightness and joy\n",
      "it's radiant and fact when i asked my daughter when she was about five years old what color fun would be she said sunshine\n",
      "so what is the sunshine you know what is this feeling that we call fun but when people tell me their stories about fun it's really interesting because the details are all different and often quite mundane but the energy running through them as the same and there are three factors that are consistently present to the point that i believe they constitute a new definition one that is a lot more\n",
      "accurate than what's in the dictionary and those three factors are playfulness connection and flow\n",
      "so by playfulness i do not mean you have to play games or god forbid make believe i just me having a light hearted attitude of doing things for the sake of doing them and not carrying too much about the outcome letting go of perfectionism when we have fun or guard is down and we're not taking ourselves too seriously\n",
      "connection or for the feeling of having a special shared experience and i do think it's possible in some circumstances to have fun alone and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings are the activity but the majority of stories of people tell me about their peak fond memories another person is involved and that's true even for interviews\n",
      "it's\n",
      "and then flow is the state where we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time you can think about an athlete little the game or like a musician plane a piece of music it's when we're in the zone\n",
      "is possible to be in flow and not have fun like if you're arguing but you cannot have fun if you're not in flow\n",
      "so playful is cash inflow all feel great on their own but when we experience all three at once something magical happens we have fun\n",
      "and that doesn't just feel good it is good for us and fact fund us so many amazingly good things for us that i personally believe that fun is not just the result of human thriving it's a cause\n",
      "so for example fun is energizing\n",
      "when people tell me their stories about fun they glow it is like a fire has been lit inside of them in the energy and the warmth of they give off is contagious\n",
      "you know so much of life drains us but fun fills us up\n",
      "fun also makes us present a lot of us put a lotta work and a trying to be more present you know we do yoga classes we meditate and that is all great or the fact that fun as a flow state means that when we're having fun we simply are present there's no other way for to happen\n",
      "fun also unites us we live in a really polar as worlds and as we whole know there's a lot of very serious problems but when we have fun with people we don't see them as different political parties or nationalities are religions reconnect with them as human beings it's worth noting that that is the first step and been able to work together\n",
      "to solve those problems\n",
      "fun also makes us healthier now being lonely and stressed out as many of us have been for the past two years causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease but when we have fun relaxed and were more socially connected both of which have the opposite effect\n",
      "so kind of blows my mind every time i think about it this way but having fun is a health intervention\n",
      "and then lastly fun is joyful in it we all so desperately want to be happy we read books about happiness we download apps buy happiness but when we are in a moment of having fun we are happy\n",
      "so makes me think that perhaps the secret to long term happiness is just to have more everyday moments of fun\n",
      "so how do we do that how do we have more fun well to start with do not take the suggestions you'll find a magazine articles about how to have more fun so i'll i looked up some of these myself when i found suggestions that include are not is up\n",
      "roasted turkey\n",
      "put together an altar to loved ones who have passed\n",
      "watch a documentary about climates\n",
      "and my personal favorite a during your table with gourds\n",
      "so go\n",
      "those are not good suggestions\n",
      "instead the most effective thing you can do to have more fun is to focus on it's ingredients are which i mean do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness connection and flow so here's my ideas for how to do so so to star with reduced distractions and order to increase flow anything that distracts you is going to kick you out to flow and prevent you from having\n",
      "fun\n",
      "and what's the number one source of distraction for most of us these days\n",
      "oh thank you\n",
      "a for target but yes your phones\n",
      "now i wrote a book called how to break up with your phone so i have strong feelings about this but i can guarantee you that you're not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone so today i want to challenge you to keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible so the you can take me up my second suggestion which is to increase connection by interacting more with other human being\n",
      "in real life\n",
      "now i know that one of the main reasons were causally on our phones is specifically to avoid having to spend time and interact with other human beings in real life\n",
      "so i want to assure you that it is worth it and it is not as hard as it might seem so here's how you do it you start by making eye contact with someone like look them in the i don't look like in the middle their forehead where the camera would be on a zoom call or\n",

      "i'm in my kitchen i just finished cooking dinner for my family and i am on edge i mean i'm exhausted i haven't been sleeping well i'm anxious about the upcoming work week i'm overwhelmed by all the items on my unfinished to do list and then my son walks into the kitchen\n",
      "he looks at the table and winds chicken again\n",
      "disgusting\n",
      "and that fit i snap i look at him and a young what is wrong with you\n",
      "can you be grateful for one thing in your life\n",
      "and things get worse from there he screams i hate you he runs out of the room and he slams his bedroom door and now my self loathing session begins as i say to myself what is wrong with me\n",
      "i've messed up my kid forever\n",
      "well if you're a parent you've probably felt at pain\n",
      "for me it comes with an extra layer of shame\n",
      "i mean i'm a clinical psychologist and my specialty is helping people become better parents\n",
      "and yet this is true as well there is no such thing as a perfect parent\n",
      "mistakes and struggles they come with the job but no one tells us what to do next\n",
      "do we just move on canvas for ten the whole thing never happen\n",
      "or if i say something what are the words\n",
      "well for years as a clinical psychologist and private practice i saw client after clients struggle with this question and now as the creator of the parenting content and community platform good inside i see millions of parents around the globe struggle with this issue\n",
      "all parents yeah\n",
      "no one knows what to do next\n",
      "well i'm determined to fill this gap after all there's almost nothing within our interpersonal relationships that can have as much impact as prepare whenever a parent ask me what one parenting strategy should i focus on i always say the same thing get good at repair\n",
      "so what is repeal\n",
      "repairs the act of going back to a moment of disconnection taking responsibility for your behavior and acknowledging the impact it had on another and i want to differentiate a repair from an apology because one an apology often looks to shut a conversation down hey i'm sorry\n",
      "the i yelled can we move on now\n",
      "a good repair opens one up\n",
      "\n",
      "so i'm a little test for you\n",

      "it's just a little test again\n",
      "first get thirty seconds to memorize ten words in the right order\n",
      "after that he got thirty seconds to write down what you remembered and then finally get thirty seconds to check your answers\n",
      "so are you guys ready\n",
      "well we're going to start anyway\n",
      "so\n",
      "memorize ten words in the right border in thirty seconds in three two one go\n",
      "okay stop\n",
      "now right down with you remember\n",
      "okay and stop\n",
      "now quickly check your answers\n",
      "okay and stop\n",
      "so\n",
      "very exciting i read a lot of running and moaning so i robot in stress you out too much\n",
      "now a moment of reflection\n",
      "i'd like you to ask yourself\n",
      "how did i memorized this and was it the best way to do it\n",
      "now for the generation of my parents and grandparents being able to memorize something like this was an absolutely essential skill but nowadays why would anyone want to remember list of anything he just take a picture the screen and you're done right\n",
      "so\n",
      "with all the technology we have these days it seemed as if memorizing is somehow become less important\n",
      "so why should we then in today's day and age still want to get better i memorizer\n",
      "well to answer that question i like to tell you a little story\n",
      "in high school\n",
      "i flunked grade\n",
      "twice\n",
      "after seven years of torture i finally got my diploma\n",
      "sweet sweet freedom\n",
      "where would i do with it\n",
      "i didn't know one thing i did know however was that i didn't want to go back to school because that all learning business\n",
      "it wasn't cut out for me\n",
      "so instead i went to sunny california for nine months and their i worked as a bagger not bigger bagger\n",
      "so in a supermarket either put people's groceries in bags and then i'd get a little tip\n",
      "surprisingly that year i learned so much i learned out a bag of groceries really really quickly\n",
      "i learn how to drive a car and in california people are a little bit more open than they are in amsterdam so i also learn how to have a little chat with a stranger just for that of it\n",
      "that year i discovered that i don't hate learning\n",
      "just a specific way of doing it\n",
      "so i decided to go and study psychology\n",
      "now for the first time ever i was getting information that i absolutely wanted to know now i was spending more time in the library in has been skipping school as a teenager\n",
      "voluntarily\n",
      "the only problem was that i was spending all of my time in the library because i never learn how to learn\n",
      "so i started experimenting with different methods of leading tax of memorizing facts and i got my reading time of three hours per chapter down to one\n",
      "this way of studying enabled me to do an honors program to get my degree and to fall in love learning\n",
      "and now i happily work for a company called reminder in which we teach people the science and art of learning\n",
      "we're trying to bring back into education but we ourselves missed\n",
      "now for the past three years we've also organized the dutch national memory championship for high schoolers\n",
      "we do this to show that everybody is capable of amazing feats of memory\n",
      "but also to show that memorization is about a lot more the just learning your printer your spanish words\n",
      "and today i also like to share this with you\n",
      "so in the beginning i made you do this little test\n",
      "just to make you aware of how your memorizing things right now\n",
      "next i like to give you a new type of memory experience is that and even sit back and relax\n",
      "some going as you to find a comfortable position a sip\n",
      "to closure as\n",
      "as take a deep breath\n",

      "the case that when we're feeling the most anxious uncomfortable socially awkward versions of ourselves when our hearts are pounding and are palms are sweating and me feel a crawling out of our skin\n",
      "are we also the most nice and often generic to the people around us\n",
      "i'm a social psychologists and i've been studying the science of uncomfortable social interactions for over twenty years so everything from new roommate relationships negotiations upward feedback with your boss to doctor patient interactions those moments where you need a break in and say your for the last twenty minutes actually have no idea what you are talking\n",
      "about can we may be rewind to bed and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback\n",
      "second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with her hair doodling then and even tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control are under the skin responses are physiology\n",
      "g r cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate he's types of things that we often don't even really realize that we're feeling and the way i do this is by having people commented lab and interact with each other and a bunch of different settings\n",
      "and i have them negotiate with each other a had them get acquainted with each other and often it's the case the in these interactions people are required to give some form of feedback to their partner tell them honestly whether thinking or feeling common with an offer for negotiation tell them what they could have done better next time\n",
      "and i think we all can you know what it feels like to be him when he studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there's a lot of equipment involved and but we plug people are tall of these things to measure these under the skin response as be video tape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned not a get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward\n",
      "maybe potentially little bit nice and want you want to think about what was the last awkward interaction the you had a so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments\n",
      "because in a couple minutes i'm actually gonna randomly call on someone based on your seats to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like\n",
      "so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first twenty seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned the heart rate goes\n",
      "up their blood pressure increases it doesn't take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it and those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who's sitting next to them in an just to get a little bit more distance\n",
      "one of my favorite findings isn't doctor patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more are they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with his patients\n",
      "so let's all return to your awkward moment is everyone have an awkward moment in mind when thinking about when\n",
      "how many of you have i increases in your heart rate maybe palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just the mere thought of being called upon today\n",
      "ag a few of you may be what are seeks be excited about that opportunity not and okay same people could pick\n",
      "how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grant through gritty greeted t like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time\n",
      "a few the of door am not going to actually do this and this was all just a ruse to teach a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often don't have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable\n",
      "no one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major from and i brought people together who are used to working with one another\n",
      "and we had him engage in a negotiation and at the end of it there was a winner in there was a loser\n",
      "so he said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential miss stops how many of you think that that's what they actually did they really followed are instructions\n",
      "hey nobody can see where this is going\n",
      "what we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to as we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you me that really early offer and didn't even ask for counter i was amazing or it was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change\n",
      "on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are\n",
      "so often these kinds of interactions the take the form of what i'll call anxious niceness and they involve lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general non specific way\n",
      "but a lot of work actually looks at what's what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of riddles smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering\n",
      "a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of\n",
      "and that anxiety is regulated by being over the top nice to these folks\n",
      "we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronize to and attentive to the how we say a peace than the what we say part someone once teddy we had black and white americans interact with each other in across race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measure the physiology of both partners\n",
      "what this allowed us to do is captured the degree to which people stress those under the skin responses can actually be caught by their partners\n",
      "and what we expect to define is that the black participants will become more synchronize physiologically to those whites the be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that's exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared for the fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol sorry\n",
      "activity indicating some real deep and of under the skin stress response the more those by participants became linked up to them over time\n",
      "and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress in our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always or owner physiology is not always around and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress a good\n",
      "negatively affect your body's\n",
      "no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you\n",
      "need to stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context\n",
      "so imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls me be passed employee recruiter cause you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things are going to put are gonna be like there are real team player they have great energy at work generic things\n",
      "yes there are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves while they must not really know this person at all or even know what this means at worst they think to themselves where they probably have some real opinions they're just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive fee\n",
      "back kinda actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data\n",
      "so i think we have didn't think about what is the solution to this problem is is the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i don't think that's the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i'm in a highly three of them to improve the degree to which we get clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace\n",
      "so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with his niceness culture really there's a bit of a plural ignorance the goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work am what i've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback\n",
      "there's another person who feels like it's lazy you feel like it's not helpful and i actually learned this lesson the hard way from one of my students recently she was giving our practice talk in my lab and she spent weeks and weeks preparing it on\n",

      "but eventually and this may be surprising that people in north america eventually we decided that the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages\n",

      "dominantly learning english and the reason for that is because english control the transform your life in most countries in the world knowledge of english and significantly increase your income potential\n",
      "so this is another reason why we decided to start with foreign languages and is because you can directly make more money if you'll learn another language in particular english and see this is pretty different than many other subjects for example big math\n",
      "because of math just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to them become a civil engineer like that's how you make more money whereas with languages if you are a waiter and you'll learn english now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money\n",
      "so we decided well let's get started teaching languages now we also convinced ourselves that the only way to really reach a lot of people west are using a mobile phone or smartphone in particular\n",
      "the building schools all over the world is simply too expensive\n",
      "on the other hand most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone and the trend is that a fraction is only going to increase so we decided that the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone and then we call it duolingo\n",
      "now in order to truly be accessible to everyone rich and poor duolingo used as a freemium model to support itself\n",
      "that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay\n",
      "but if you don't pay you may have to see an ad at the end of a lesson\n",
      "and if you don't like ads you can also paid to describe the turn of the ads\n",
      "and it turns out that the vast majority of the revenue for duolingo comes from people to pay described to turn of the ass\n",
      "and now for these people who pay to suspend the turn of the as well they're usually people that well off people in rich countries like the us and canada who are the people who don't pay does as by be usually come from poorer countries like brazil or vietnam or one ammo\n",
      "what i like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically a rich people to pay for the occasion education of everyone so i like that\n",
      "it's a great so with smartphones we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people to pay for the whole thing spread however if you're trying to deliver education with a smartphone you run into a humongous problem\n",
      "and it is that smartphones comic but with some of the most i forgive drugs to humanity has engineered it doctor instagram mobile games\n",
      "seat delivering education of our smartphone is like hoping that people will eat your broccoli or right next to it you put the most delicious dessert ever made\n",
      "if if you really want to deliver education to everyone not only do you have to make it accessible but also you have to make it so that people want to actually learn\n",
      "and we do willing we've been able to do this and at the highest level the where we've done this is by making the broccoli there's like desert\n",
      "i say it another way what we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that\n",
      "apps like instagram up or mobile games used to keep people engaged in this case we use them to keep you engaged with education\n",
      "and even some examples of these techniques one of the most powerful ones is the notion of a streak what a streak is is is just a counter measures a number of days that you've used the proud of consecutive you just think that number you put a very prominently in your product and then people come back every day and the reason people come back every day is because\n",

      "that basically choose this when to send the notification and also what to say in his notification to maximize the probability that people come back\n",
      "now interestingly even after all the sophistication it turns out that the algorithm for choosing what i'm to send your notification is pretty simple\n",

      "funny\n",
      "now with notifications you shouldn't be spam and we're not spamming with duolingo actually stop sending notifications after seven days of and activities of you don't use duolingo for seven days we stopped and the you notifications not some point it occurred to us if we're stopping the send people don't have a good as we should let them know so i we started sending this notification two people saying it is a reminder\n",

      "i don't actually believe that there's a way to make an educational app yes engaging something like picked up where instagram or mobile games\n",
      "but the good news is that and by the way to the reason i don't believe that is because ultimately you have to teach people something and it's hard to compete with like cats and celebrities i'm but the good news is the i don't think you have to so here's the thing when you're learning something you get meaning out of it whereas when you're scrolling for two hours and instagram a lot of times afterwards if\n",
      "you're lucky you just wasted your time so i think it's actually okay if your educational product is only eighty or ninety percent as engaging or something like ticked off because the other ten or twenty percent will be provided by people's internal motivational though of course not much more than that\n",
      "this is really a key point if we want to get people to do something\n",
      "meaningful you can use the same techniques that apps like social media use to get people to do it and even if you're not as engaging as those apps are you can still get hundreds of millions of people to use your product in the case of duolingo for example there are more people learning languages on duolingo in the united states and there are people learning languages across all us high school\n",

      "basically what this is his math in of course you know ai and machine learning has allowed this to be done at a very very big skill and what we have seen the result of this is that he learns the interest signals that people exhibit very quickly and shows you content is really relevant for you\n",
      "in a very in in a very quick way not so it's for it's a form of collaborative filtering from what you're saying that yes the theory behind it is the is humans a weird people we don't really know there's them but if if we see that one human is interested with an overlap of someone else chances are you know you can you can make use of the other pieces that are in that overlap\n",
      "humans repertoire to to to feed feed them and they'll be surprised but the reason they like it is because their power also like that it's his pattern recognition based on your interest signals and i think the other thing here is that we don't actually ask you twenty questions on whether you like a piece of content you know what are your interest we don't do that we\n",

      "i mean lots of\n",
      "startups have tried to use these these types of techniques i'm wondering what else played a role early on him and how how big a deal was a the from the get go you optimizing for smartphones so the videos was shot in for correct format and and they and they were short was that it was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered i think we would have first the really tried\n",
      "this scale you know the recommendation algorithm is a very important reason as to why the the perform is so popular occur among so many people are beyond that you mention\n",
      "the format of itself so we talked about the vision of the company which has to have a window to discover in if you sort of just up for the first time you see to it takes up your screen so does the window that we want you can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their lives then you know through this recommendation algorithm we have found it\n",
      "it connects people together people find communities and i've heard so many stories of people were found their communities because of the contended a posting now give you an example of\n",
      "i was in dc recently and i met with a bunch of creators i heard\n",

      "she started posting on this content on tick tock end up you know i saw his content in looks of i was hungry after looking at it's is great you know content in his generators so much interest in his business the last year he mean something like a million dollars in revenue\n",
      "just via tick tock one restaurant and in again and again a huge his stories by connecting people together by giving people the window to discover we have forgiven many small businesses and many people your common person a voice that it would never otherwise have and i think that's the power of the platform\n",
      "so you definitely have identified early just how in our social creatures we need affirmation i'm i've had a story and you can tell me whether true or not the one of the keys to your early lift off was that you want to persuade creators who are trying out tick tock that this was a platform where you know they would get whisper\n",
      "early on when you're trying to grow something in the numbers on that response so you had a brilliant idea of goosing those numbers a bit basically finding ways to give people you know a big a sense of lot more likes more engagement and was actually the case by using a i agent somehow in the in the process is is a brilliant idea is that are the\n",
      "just a myth i would\n",
      "i would i would describe it in a different way so the other platforms to exist they don't with before tick tock in if you think about this platforms you sort of have to be famous already in order to go followers because the we is build is that people come and follow people and if we don't if you aren't really famous the chances that you get discovered a very\n",
      "every law now what we have done again because of the difference in the we were recommended content is that we have given any one any single person with enough talent a speech to be able to be discovered in i think that actually is the single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform and again and again you will hear stories\n",
      "from people who use the platform or post regularly on it that if the have something you want to see the performed just them the chance and the stage to connect with the audience in a way that i think no other products in the past as ever offered them\n",
      "so i'm i'm just trying to play back what what use what you said they you said you were describing their differ way what i what i said is is it that in the case that like to give someone a decent chance someone who's brilliant but doesn't come with any follow as initially that you you have you got some technique to identify talent and that you will you will almost encourage them you will you will give them some guy\n",
      "and of from artificially increase the number of followers were like so whatever that they have so the others are encouraged to go wow there's something there and so forth like it's this idea of critical mass that kind of every entrepreneur every party planner kind of those about of the know this is the hot place in town everyone calm and that that is how you actually game critical mass we we wanted\n",
      "sure that every person who posts a video is given and an equal chance to be able to have some audience to begin with but this idea that you are the media alluding to that we can get people to like something it doesn't really work like that you don't then you get could you get a i agents to like something for you see the network way\n",
      "with extra and for could kind of get you know give give someone early encouragement ultimately what the machine does is he recognizes people's interests so if you post something that's not interesting though a lot of people even if you gave it a lot of exposure you're not going to get of morality that you what whereas come so is is a lot of you know there's no\n",

      "and want to give you all some suggestions for things you can do starting right now to experience it's power for yourself\n",
      "so the first thing we need to start with i am is the fact that fun is a feeling and it's not an activity and it's important because a lotta times when i ask people what's fun though respond with a list of activities that they enjoyed you know the same dancing is fun or scheme as finer i don't know pickle ball is fine\n",
      "everyone seems to think that pickle ball is fun\n",
      "and assure people can be fun but we've all had experiences were something's off and an activity that seems like it would be fun doesn't end up feeling fun\n",
      "and then on the flipside we've had experiences were something that doesn't seem like would be fun at all and the feeling ridiculously fun is an element of serendipity it when people do have fun when they experienced this feeling it's actually very easy to recognize because people who are having fun look like they're being illuminated from within\n",
      "so for example here's me and my husband having fun together\n",
      "here's some president's having fun together\n",
      "here's archbishop desmond tutu and the dalai lama having fun together\n",
      "actually those to seem like they were very often even constantly\n",
      "having fun together\n",
      "and as you can see in these photographs true fun produces this visceral sense of lightness and joy\n",
      "it's radiant and fact when i asked my daughter when she was about five years old what color fun would be she said sunshine\n",
      "so what is the sunshine you know what is this feeling that we call fun but when people tell me their stories about fun it's really interesting because the details are all different and often quite mundane but the energy running through them as the same and there are three factors that are consistently present to the point that i believe they constitute a new definition one that is a lot more\n",
      "accurate than what's in the dictionary and those three factors are playfulness connection and flow\n",
      "so by playfulness i do not mean you have to play games or god forbid make believe i just me having a light hearted attitude of doing things for the sake of doing them and not carrying too much about the outcome letting go of perfectionism when we have fun or guard is down and we're not taking ourselves too seriously\n",
      "connection or for the feeling of having a special shared experience and i do think it's possible in some circumstances to have fun alone and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings are the activity but the majority of stories of people tell me about their peak fond memories another person is involved and that's true even for interviews\n",
      "it's\n",
      "and then flow is the state where we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time you can think about an athlete little the game or like a musician plane a piece of music it's when we're in the zone\n",
      "is possible to be in flow and not have fun like if you're arguing but you cannot have fun if you're not in flow\n",
      "so playful is cash inflow all feel great on their own but when we experience all three at once something magical happens we have fun\n",
      "and that doesn't just feel good it is good for us and fact fund us so many amazingly good things for us that i personally believe that fun is not just the result of human thriving it's a cause\n",
      "so for example fun is energizing\n",
      "when people tell me their stories about fun they glow it is like a fire has been lit inside of them in the energy and the warmth of they give off is contagious\n",
      "you know so much of life drains us but fun fills us up\n",
      "fun also makes us present a lot of us put a lotta work and a trying to be more present you know we do yoga classes we meditate and that is all great or the fact that fun as a flow state means that when we're having fun we simply are present there's no other way for to happen\n",
      "fun also unites us we live in a really polar as worlds and as we whole know there's a lot of very serious problems but when we have fun with people we don't see them as different political parties or nationalities are religions reconnect with them as human beings it's worth noting that that is the first step and been able to work together\n",
      "to solve those problems\n",
      "fun also makes us healthier now being lonely and stressed out as many of us have been for the past two years causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease but when we have fun relaxed and were more socially connected both of which have the opposite effect\n",
      "so kind of blows my mind every time i think about it this way but having fun is a health intervention\n",
      "and then lastly fun is joyful in it we all so desperately want to be happy we read books about happiness we download apps buy happiness but when we are in a moment of having fun we are happy\n",
      "so makes me think that perhaps the secret to long term happiness is just to have more everyday moments of fun\n",
      "so how do we do that how do we have more fun well to start with do not take the suggestions you'll find a magazine articles about how to have more fun so i'll i looked up some of these myself when i found suggestions that include are not is up\n",
      "roasted turkey\n",
      "put together an altar to loved ones who have passed\n",
      "watch a documentary about climates\n",
      "and my personal favorite a during your table with gourds\n",
      "so go\n",
      "those are not good suggestions\n",
      "instead the most effective thing you can do to have more fun is to focus on it's ingredients are which i mean do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness connection and flow so here's my ideas for how to do so so to star with reduced distractions and order to increase flow anything that distracts you is going to kick you out to flow and prevent you from having\n",
      "fun\n",
      "and what's the number one source of distraction for most of us these days\n",
      "oh thank you\n",
      "a for target but yes your phones\n",
      "now i wrote a book called how to break up with your phone so i have strong feelings about this but i can guarantee you that you're not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone so today i want to challenge you to keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible so the you can take me up my second suggestion which is to increase connection by interacting more with other human being\n",
      "in real life\n",
      "now i know that one of the main reasons were causally on our phones is specifically to avoid having to spend time and interact with other human beings in real life\n",
      "so i want to assure you that it is worth it and it is not as hard as it might seem so here's how you do it you start by making eye contact with someone like look them in the i don't look like in the middle their forehead where the camera would be on a zoom call or\n",

      "about can we may be rewind to bed and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback\n",
      "second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with her hair doodling then and even tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control are under the skin responses are physiology\n",
      "g r cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate he's types of things that we often don't even really realize that we're feeling and the way i do this is by having people commented lab and interact with each other and a bunch of different settings\n",
      "and i have them negotiate with each other a had them get acquainted with each other and often it's the case the in these interactions people are required to give some form of feedback to their partner tell them honestly whether thinking or feeling common with an offer for negotiation tell them what they could have done better next time\n",
      "and i think we all can you know what it feels like to be him when he studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there's a lot of equipment involved and but we plug people are tall of these things to measure these under the skin response as be video tape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned not a get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward\n",
      "maybe potentially little bit nice and want you want to think about what was the last awkward interaction the you had a so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments\n",
      "because in a couple minutes i'm actually gonna randomly call on someone based on your seats to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like\n",
      "so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first twenty seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned the heart rate goes\n",
      "up their blood pressure increases it doesn't take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it and those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who's sitting next to them in an just to get a little bit more distance\n",
      "one of my favorite findings isn't doctor patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more are they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with his patients\n",
      "so let's all return to your awkward moment is everyone have an awkward moment in mind when thinking about when\n",
      "how many of you have i increases in your heart rate maybe palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just the mere thought of being called upon today\n",
      "ag a few of you may be what are seeks be excited about that opportunity not and okay same people could pick\n",
      "how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grant through gritty greeted t like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time\n",
      "a few the of door am not going to actually do this and this was all just a ruse to teach a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often don't have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable\n",
      "no one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major from and i brought people together who are used to working with one another\n",
      "and we had him engage in a negotiation and at the end of it there was a winner in there was a loser\n",
      "so he said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential miss stops how many of you think that that's what they actually did they really followed are instructions\n",
      "hey nobody can see where this is going\n",
      "what we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to as we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you me that really early offer and didn't even ask for counter i was amazing or it was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change\n",
      "on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are\n",
      "so often these kinds of interactions the take the form of what i'll call anxious niceness and they involve lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general non specific way\n",
      "but a lot of work actually looks at what's what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of riddles smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering\n",
      "a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of\n",
      "and that anxiety is regulated by being over the top nice to these folks\n",
      "we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronize to and attentive to the how we say a peace than the what we say part someone once teddy we had black and white americans interact with each other in across race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measure the physiology of both partners\n",
      "what this allowed us to do is captured the degree to which people stress those under the skin responses can actually be caught by their partners\n",
      "and what we expect to define is that the black participants will become more synchronize physiologically to those whites the be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that's exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared for the fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol sorry\n",
      "activity indicating some real deep and of under the skin stress response the more those by participants became linked up to them over time\n",
      "and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress in our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always or owner physiology is not always around and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress a good\n",
      "negatively affect your body's\n",
      "no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you\n",
      "need to stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context\n",
      "so imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls me be passed employee recruiter cause you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things are going to put are gonna be like there are real team player they have great energy at work generic things\n",
      "yes there are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves while they must not really know this person at all or even know what this means at worst they think to themselves where they probably have some real opinions they're just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive fee\n",
      "back kinda actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data\n",
      "so i think we have didn't think about what is the solution to this problem is is the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i don't think that's the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i'm in a highly three of them to improve the degree to which we get clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace\n",
      "so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with his niceness culture really there's a bit of a plural ignorance the goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work am what i've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback\n",
      "there's another person who feels like it's lazy you feel like it's not helpful and i actually learned this lesson the hard way from one of my students recently she was giving our practice talk in my lab and she spent weeks and weeks preparing it on\n",

      "but eventually and this may be surprising that people in north america eventually we decided that the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages\n",
      "and let me tell you why is a number of reasons i'm one of them is that there's a huge audience for it is a two billion people in the world earning a foreign language of in school and outside of schools most of these people went away i learning english about eighty percent of them are learning english and this weird map i hear all the countries in green a countries in which people are pretty\n",
      "dominantly learning english and the reason for that is because english control the transform your life in most countries in the world knowledge of english and significantly increase your income potential\n",
      "so this is another reason why we decided to start with foreign languages and is because you can directly make more money if you'll learn another language in particular english and see this is pretty different than many other subjects for example big math\n",
      "because of math just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to them become a civil engineer like that's how you make more money whereas with languages if you are a waiter and you'll learn english now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money\n",
      "so we decided well let's get started teaching languages now we also convinced ourselves that the only way to really reach a lot of people west are using a mobile phone or smartphone in particular\n",
      "the building schools all over the world is simply too expensive\n",
      "on the other hand most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone and the trend is that a fraction is only going to increase so we decided that the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone and then we call it duolingo\n",
      "now in order to truly be accessible to everyone rich and poor duolingo used as a freemium model to support itself\n",
      "that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay\n",
      "but if you don't pay you may have to see an ad at the end of a lesson\n",
      "and if you don't like ads you can also paid to describe the turn of the ads\n",
      "and it turns out that the vast majority of the revenue for duolingo comes from people to pay described to turn of the ass\n",
      "and now for these people who pay to suspend the turn of the as well they're usually people that well off people in rich countries like the us and canada who are the people who don't pay does as by be usually come from poorer countries like brazil or vietnam or one ammo\n",
      "what i like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically a rich people to pay for the occasion education of everyone so i like that\n",
      "it's a great so with smartphones we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people to pay for the whole thing spread however if you're trying to deliver education with a smartphone you run into a humongous problem\n",
      "and it is that smartphones comic but with some of the most i forgive drugs to humanity has engineered it doctor instagram mobile games\n",
      "seat delivering education of our smartphone is like hoping that people will eat your broccoli or right next to it you put the most delicious dessert ever made\n",
      "if if you really want to deliver education to everyone not only do you have to make it accessible but also you have to make it so that people want to actually learn\n",
      "and we do willing we've been able to do this and at the highest level the where we've done this is by making the broccoli there's like desert\n",
      "i say it another way what we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that\n",
      "apps like instagram up or mobile games used to keep people engaged in this case we use them to keep you engaged with education\n",
      "and even some examples of these techniques one of the most powerful ones is the notion of a streak what a streak is is is just a counter measures a number of days that you've used the proud of consecutive you just think that number you put a very prominently in your product and then people come back every day and the reason people come back every day is because\n",

      "another important mechanism to get people to come back to your product or notifications on the ones i notifications can be released on the and annoying but in the case of an educational product you will actually want to be reminded to learn and because of duolingo we have a very sophisticated ai system\n",
      "that basically choose this when to send the notification and also what to say in his notification to maximize the probability that people come back\n",
      "now interestingly even after all the sophistication it turns out that the algorithm for choosing what i'm to send your notification is pretty simple\n",
      "you know what is the best time to send people a notification i'll tell you it's twenty four hours after they use the brought up last\n",

      "and so this is what a very sophisticated millions of dollars of a i found\n",
      "funny\n",
      "now with notifications you shouldn't be spam and we're not spamming with duolingo actually stop sending notifications after seven days of and activities of you don't use duolingo for seven days we stopped and the you notifications not some point it occurred to us if we're stopping the send people don't have a good as we should let them know so i we started sending this notification two people saying it is a reminder\n",

      "so they come back and speaking of a green our mascot by the way because all our notifications come from our green our mascot and well his passive aggressive and also pretty bushy this is given rise to a lot of names on the internet that make fun of just the great lengths that he will go through get you back to learn a language is one of my favorite ones this is it's a meme my favorite ones\n",
      "basically looks like you forgot your spanish lessons and then there's an intruder lend presumably the al broke into your house to give you learn language\n",
      "now duolingo has entered the decide guest and this this thousands of means there's some else gets about it and it's because we've managed to get people to want to learn a language by using the same techniques that\n",
      "mobile games and social media use to get people engaged and\n",
      "this is a really important point let me say this am\n",
      "i don't actually believe that there's a way to make an educational app yes engaging something like picked up where instagram or mobile games\n",
      "but the good news is that and by the way to the reason i don't believe that is because ultimately you have to teach people something and it's hard to compete with like cats and celebrities i'm but the good news is the i don't think you have to so here's the thing when you're learning something you get meaning out of it whereas when you're scrolling for two hours and instagram a lot of times afterwards if\n",
      "you're lucky you just wasted your time so i think it's actually okay if your educational product is only eighty or ninety percent as engaging or something like ticked off because the other ten or twenty percent will be provided by people's internal motivational though of course not much more than that\n",
      "this is really a key point if we want to get people to do something\n",
      "meaningful you can use the same techniques that apps like social media use to get people to do it and even if you're not as engaging as those apps are you can still get hundreds of millions of people to use your product in the case of duolingo for example there are more people learning languages on duolingo in the united states and there are people learning languages across all us high school\n",

      "what if you like videos one two three and four and i like videos one two three and five maybe he liked videos one two three and six know what's gonna happen is because we like one two three yeah the same time he's going to be shown four five six and so army and you can thing about this repeated at skill in real time across more than a billion people sp\n",
      "basically what this is his math in of course you know ai and machine learning has allowed this to be done at a very very big skill and what we have seen the result of this is that he learns the interest signals that people exhibit very quickly and shows you content is really relevant for you\n",
      "in a very in in a very quick way not so it's for it's a form of collaborative filtering from what you're saying that yes the theory behind it is the is humans a weird people we don't really know there's them but if if we see that one human is interested with an overlap of someone else chances are you know you can you can make use of the other pieces that are in that overlap\n",
      "humans repertoire to to to feed feed them and they'll be surprised but the reason they like it is because their power also like that it's his pattern recognition based on your interest signals and i think the other thing here is that we don't actually ask you twenty questions on whether you like a piece of content you know what are your interest we don't do that we\n",
      "built that experience organically into the of experience so you're voting with a thumbs in know by watching a video you know by citing it by liking it by sharing it you're basically exhibiting interest signals and what it does and a medically is a take those signals put in a formula and a matches it through pattern recognition that's basically the\n",

      "i mean lots of\n",
      "startups have tried to use these these types of techniques i'm wondering what else played a role early on him and how how big a deal was a the from the get go you optimizing for smartphones so the videos was shot in for correct format and and they and they were short was that it was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered i think we would have first the really tried\n",
      "this scale you know the recommendation algorithm is a very important reason as to why the the perform is so popular occur among so many people are beyond that you mention\n",
      "the format of itself so we talked about the vision of the company which has to have a window to discover in if you sort of just up for the first time you see to it takes up your screen so does the window that we want you can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their lives then you know through this recommendation algorithm we have found it\n",
      "it connects people together people find communities and i've heard so many stories of people were found their communities because of the contended a posting now give you an example of\n",
      "i was in dc recently and i met with a bunch of creators i heard\n",
      "and so one of them are sitting next to me at a dinner his name is samuel he was a restaurant in phoenix arizona and is a taco restaurant he told me he's never done this before first you know venture\n",
      "she started posting on this content on tick tock end up you know i saw his content in looks of i was hungry after looking at it's is great you know content in his generators so much interest in his business the last year he mean something like a million dollars in revenue\n",
      "just via tick tock one restaurant and in again and again a huge his stories by connecting people together by giving people the window to discover we have forgiven many small businesses and many people your common person a voice that it would never otherwise have and i think that's the power of the platform\n",
      "so you definitely have identified early just how in our social creatures we need affirmation i'm i've had a story and you can tell me whether true or not the one of the keys to your early lift off was that you want to persuade creators who are trying out tick tock that this was a platform where you know they would get whisper\n",
      "early on when you're trying to grow something in the numbers on that response so you had a brilliant idea of goosing those numbers a bit basically finding ways to give people you know a big a sense of lot more likes more engagement and was actually the case by using a i agent somehow in the in the process is is a brilliant idea is that are the\n",
      "just a myth i would\n",
      "i would i would describe it in a different way so the other platforms to exist they don't with before tick tock in if you think about this platforms you sort of have to be famous already in order to go followers because the we is build is that people come and follow people and if we don't if you aren't really famous the chances that you get discovered a very\n",
      "every law now what we have done again because of the difference in the we were recommended content is that we have given any one any single person with enough talent a speech to be able to be discovered in i think that actually is the single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform and again and again you will hear stories\n",
      "from people who use the platform or post regularly on it that if the have something you want to see the performed just them the chance and the stage to connect with the audience in a way that i think no other products in the past as ever offered them\n",
      "so i'm i'm just trying to play back what what use what you said they you said you were describing their differ way what i what i said is is it that in the case that like to give someone a decent chance someone who's brilliant but doesn't come with any follow as initially that you you have you got some technique to identify talent and that you will you will almost encourage them you will you will give them some guy\n",
      "and of from artificially increase the number of followers were like so whatever that they have so the others are encouraged to go wow there's something there and so forth like it's this idea of critical mass that kind of every entrepreneur every party planner kind of those about of the know this is the hot place in town everyone calm and that that is how you actually game critical mass we we wanted\n",
      "sure that every person who posts a video is given and an equal chance to be able to have some audience to begin with but this idea that you are the media alluding to that we can get people to like something it doesn't really work like that you don't then you get could you get a i agents to like something for you see the network way\n",
      "with extra and for could kind of get you know give give someone early encouragement ultimately what the machine does is he recognizes people's interests so if you post something that's not interesting though a lot of people even if you gave it a lot of exposure you're not going to get of morality that you what whereas come so is is a lot of you know there's no\n",
      "there's no push your you know it's not like you can go and push something and because i like chris huhne on going to push your content and doesn't work like that you got to have a message to residents are people and if it does then he will automatically just have to borrow the itself that's the beauty of user generated content it's is not something that can be engineered oh\n",

      "ninety percent of the drugs work in only thirty to fifty percent of the people so the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed staten what do you suppose it is\n",

      "i think we know that on some level i think that's part of the reason we keep ourselves so busy and distracted to begin with but we don't know what to do about it\n",

      "we need to have more fun\n",
      "so you might think that you're already having plenty of fun and that's because in our everyday speech we often use the word fun to describe anything we do have our leisure time even if it's not actually enjoyable and in fact a waste of time servers\n",
      "so for example we scroll through social media for fun even though doing so often makes us feel bad about like kind of everything or will say there was so fun we should do that again soon and respect\n",
      "in response to things they worried that fun and that we don't want to do again\n",
      "ever\n",

      "but if you think back on your own memories that stand out to you as having truly been fine and i really encourage you to do this year the memories that you would describe as and forgive me for i scientific terminology so fun\n",
      "you're going to notice that there's something much deeper going on\n",
      "i've collected thousands of these stories from people all around the world and i can tell you it's amazing because when people were count the memories in which they had the most fun\n",
      "they tell you about some of the most joyful and treasured memories of their lives\n",
      "so in reality fun is not just light hearted pleasure\n",
      "it's not just for kids and it is definitely not frivolous instead fun as the secrets of feeling alive\n",
      "so today i want to propose to a new more precise definition of what fun is i want to reveal some of the ways in which it is astonishingly good for us\n",
      "and want to give you all some suggestions for things you can do starting right now to experience it's power for yourself\n",
      "so the first thing we need to start with i am is the fact that fun is a feeling and it's not an activity and it's important because a lotta times when i ask people what's fun though respond with a list of activities that they enjoyed you know the same dancing is fun or scheme as finer i don't know pickle ball is fine\n",
      "everyone seems to think that pickle ball is fun\n",
      "and assure people can be fun but we've all had experiences were something's off and an activity that seems like it would be fun doesn't end up feeling fun\n",
      "and then on the flipside we've had experiences were something that doesn't seem like would be fun at all and the feeling ridiculously fun is an element of serendipity it when people do have fun when they experienced this feeling it's actually very easy to recognize because people who are having fun look like they're being illuminated from within\n",
      "so for example here's me and my husband having fun together\n",
      "here's some president's having fun together\n",
      "here's archbishop desmond tutu and the dalai lama having fun together\n",
      "actually those to seem like they were very often even constantly\n",
      "having fun together\n",
      "and as you can see in these photographs true fun produces this visceral sense of lightness and joy\n",
      "it's radiant and fact when i asked my daughter when she was about five years old what color fun would be she said sunshine\n",
      "so what is the sunshine you know what is this feeling that we call fun but when people tell me their stories about fun it's really interesting because the details are all different and often quite mundane but the energy running through them as the same and there are three factors that are consistently present to the point that i believe they constitute a new definition one that is a lot more\n",
      "accurate than what's in the dictionary and those three factors are playfulness connection and flow\n",
      "so by playfulness i do not mean you have to play games or god forbid make believe i just me having a light hearted attitude of doing things for the sake of doing them and not carrying too much about the outcome letting go of perfectionism when we have fun or guard is down and we're not taking ourselves too seriously\n",
      "connection or for the feeling of having a special shared experience and i do think it's possible in some circumstances to have fun alone and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings are the activity but the majority of stories of people tell me about their peak fond memories another person is involved and that's true even for interviews\n",
      "it's\n",
      "and then flow is the state where we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time you can think about an athlete little the game or like a musician plane a piece of music it's when we're in the zone\n",
      "is possible to be in flow and not have fun like if you're arguing but you cannot have fun if you're not in flow\n",
      "so playful is cash inflow all feel great on their own but when we experience all three at once something magical happens we have fun\n",
      "and that doesn't just feel good it is good for us and fact fund us so many amazingly good things for us that i personally believe that fun is not just the result of human thriving it's a cause\n",
      "so for example fun is energizing\n",
      "when people tell me their stories about fun they glow it is like a fire has been lit inside of them in the energy and the warmth of they give off is contagious\n",
      "you know so much of life drains us but fun fills us up\n",
      "fun also makes us present a lot of us put a lotta work and a trying to be more present you know we do yoga classes we meditate and that is all great or the fact that fun as a flow state means that when we're having fun we simply are present there's no other way for to happen\n",
      "fun also unites us we live in a really polar as worlds and as we whole know there's a lot of very serious problems but when we have fun with people we don't see them as different political parties or nationalities are religions reconnect with them as human beings it's worth noting that that is the first step and been able to work together\n",
      "to solve those problems\n",
      "fun also makes us healthier now being lonely and stressed out as many of us have been for the past two years causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease but when we have fun relaxed and were more socially connected both of which have the opposite effect\n",
      "so kind of blows my mind every time i think about it this way but having fun is a health intervention\n",
      "and then lastly fun is joyful in it we all so desperately want to be happy we read books about happiness we download apps buy happiness but when we are in a moment of having fun we are happy\n",
      "so makes me think that perhaps the secret to long term happiness is just to have more everyday moments of fun\n",
      "so how do we do that how do we have more fun well to start with do not take the suggestions you'll find a magazine articles about how to have more fun so i'll i looked up some of these myself when i found suggestions that include are not is up\n",
      "roasted turkey\n",
      "put together an altar to loved ones who have passed\n",
      "watch a documentary about climates\n",
      "and my personal favorite a during your table with gourds\n",
      "so go\n",
      "those are not good suggestions\n",
      "instead the most effective thing you can do to have more fun is to focus on it's ingredients are which i mean do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness connection and flow so here's my ideas for how to do so so to star with reduced distractions and order to increase flow anything that distracts you is going to kick you out to flow and prevent you from having\n",
      "fun\n",
      "and what's the number one source of distraction for most of us these days\n",
      "oh thank you\n",
      "a for target but yes your phones\n",
      "now i wrote a book called how to break up with your phone so i have strong feelings about this but i can guarantee you that you're not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone so today i want to challenge you to keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible so the you can take me up my second suggestion which is to increase connection by interacting more with other human being\n",
      "in real life\n",
      "now i know that one of the main reasons were causally on our phones is specifically to avoid having to spend time and interact with other human beings in real life\n",
      "so i want to assure you that it is worth it and it is not as hard as it might seem so here's how you do it you start by making eye contact with someone like look them in the i don't look like in the middle their forehead where the camera would be on a zoom call or\n",
      "and you say hello\n",

      "about can we may be rewind to bed and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback\n",
      "second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with her hair doodling then and even tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control are under the skin responses are physiology\n",
      "g r cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate he's types of things that we often don't even really realize that we're feeling and the way i do this is by having people commented lab and interact with each other and a bunch of different settings\n",
      "and i have them negotiate with each other a had them get acquainted with each other and often it's the case the in these interactions people are required to give some form of feedback to their partner tell them honestly whether thinking or feeling common with an offer for negotiation tell them what they could have done better next time\n",
      "and i think we all can you know what it feels like to be him when he studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there's a lot of equipment involved and but we plug people are tall of these things to measure these under the skin response as be video tape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned not a get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward\n",
      "maybe potentially little bit nice and want you want to think about what was the last awkward interaction the you had a so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments\n",

      "so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first twenty seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned the heart rate goes\n",
      "up their blood pressure increases it doesn't take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it and those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who's sitting next to them in an just to get a little bit more distance\n",
      "one of my favorite findings isn't doctor patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more are they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with his patients\n",
      "so let's all return to your awkward moment is everyone have an awkward moment in mind when thinking about when\n",
      "how many of you have i increases in your heart rate maybe palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just the mere thought of being called upon today\n",

      "how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grant through gritty greeted t like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time\n",
      "a few the of door am not going to actually do this and this was all just a ruse to teach a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often don't have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable\n",
      "no one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major from and i brought people together who are used to working with one another\n",
      "and we had him engage in a negotiation and at the end of it there was a winner in there was a loser\n",
      "so he said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential miss stops how many of you think that that's what they actually did they really followed are instructions\n",
      "hey nobody can see where this is going\n",
      "what we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to as we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you me that really early offer and didn't even ask for counter i was amazing or it was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change\n",
      "on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are\n",
      "so often these kinds of interactions the take the form of what i'll call anxious niceness and they involve lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general non specific way\n",
      "but a lot of work actually looks at what's what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of riddles smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering\n",
      "a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of\n",
      "and that anxiety is regulated by being over the top nice to these folks\n",
      "we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronize to and attentive to the how we say a peace than the what we say part someone once teddy we had black and white americans interact with each other in across race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measure the physiology of both partners\n",
      "what this allowed us to do is captured the degree to which people stress those under the skin responses can actually be caught by their partners\n",
      "and what we expect to define is that the black participants will become more synchronize physiologically to those whites the be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that's exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared for the fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol sorry\n",
      "activity indicating some real deep and of under the skin stress response the more those by participants became linked up to them over time\n",
      "and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress in our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always or owner physiology is not always around and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress a good\n",
      "negatively affect your body's\n",
      "no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you\n",
      "need to stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context\n",
      "so imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls me be passed employee recruiter cause you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things are going to put are gonna be like there are real team player they have great energy at work generic things\n",
      "yes there are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves while they must not really know this person at all or even know what this means at worst they think to themselves where they probably have some real opinions they're just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive fee\n",
      "back kinda actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data\n",
      "so i think we have didn't think about what is the solution to this problem is is the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i don't think that's the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i'm in a highly three of them to improve the degree to which we get clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace\n",
      "so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with his niceness culture really there's a bit of a plural ignorance the goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work am what i've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback\n",

      "what am i was it's a very poor country and a lot of people talk about education or something that brings equality to different social classes but i always it has the opposite some them brings inequality\n",
      "because what happens in practice is that people who have a lot of money and by themselves a really good education and therefore continue having a lot of money whereas people who don't have very much money and they learn how to read and write and therefore never make a lot of money and this is especially true in poor countries\n",
      "now i was fortunate that i received a rich person's education\n",
      "even though i didn't grow up rich and it's because i'm an only child\n",
      "and my mother who was a single mothers and all of our resources on my education\n",
      "and this allow me to come to college to the u s and eventually get a phd in computer science\n",
      "now because of all of us\n",
      "about ten years ago i decided i wanted to do something that would give equal access to education to everyone\n",
      "and by the way this is what i want to talk to about three given equal access to education to everyone\n",
      "at the time i was a professor of computer science at carnegie mellon university and i decided to work on this with my phd student summary\n",
      "the way my brain works olive education is just too general have a problem\n",
      "so i decided let's start teaching one thing and then i started thinking okay well what should we teach first to teach math mean we both loved math me and my cofounder we both have math and now we we didn't decide to do math then we fighting and well maybe you should teach computer science\n",
      "but eventually and this may be surprising that people in north america eventually we decided that the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages\n",
      "and let me tell you why is a number of reasons i'm one of them is that there's a huge audience for it is a two billion people in the world earning a foreign language of in school and outside of schools most of these people went away i learning english about eighty percent of them are learning english and this weird map i hear all the countries in green a countries in which people are pretty\n",
      "dominantly learning english and the reason for that is because english control the transform your life in most countries in the world knowledge of english and significantly increase your income potential\n",
      "so this is another reason why we decided to start with foreign languages and is because you can directly make more money if you'll learn another language in particular english and see this is pretty different than many other subjects for example big math\n",
      "because of math just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to them become a civil engineer like that's how you make more money whereas with languages if you are a waiter and you'll learn english now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money\n",
      "so we decided well let's get started teaching languages now we also convinced ourselves that the only way to really reach a lot of people west are using a mobile phone or smartphone in particular\n",
      "the building schools all over the world is simply too expensive\n",
      "on the other hand most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone and the trend is that a fraction is only going to increase so we decided that the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone and then we call it duolingo\n",
      "now in order to truly be accessible to everyone rich and poor duolingo used as a freemium model to support itself\n",
      "that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay\n",
      "but if you don't pay you may have to see an ad at the end of a lesson\n",
      "and if you don't like ads you can also paid to describe the turn of the ads\n",
      "and it turns out that the vast majority of the revenue for duolingo comes from people to pay described to turn of the ass\n",
      "and now for these people who pay to suspend the turn of the as well they're usually people that well off people in rich countries like the us and canada who are the people who don't pay does as by be usually come from poorer countries like brazil or vietnam or one ammo\n",
      "what i like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically a rich people to pay for the occasion education of everyone so i like that\n",
      "it's a great so with smartphones we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people to pay for the whole thing spread however if you're trying to deliver education with a smartphone you run into a humongous problem\n",
      "and it is that smartphones comic but with some of the most i forgive drugs to humanity has engineered it doctor instagram mobile games\n",
      "seat delivering education of our smartphone is like hoping that people will eat your broccoli or right next to it you put the most delicious dessert ever made\n",
      "if if you really want to deliver education to everyone not only do you have to make it accessible but also you have to make it so that people want to actually learn\n",
      "and we do willing we've been able to do this and at the highest level the where we've done this is by making the broccoli there's like desert\n",
      "i say it another way what we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that\n",
      "apps like instagram up or mobile games used to keep people engaged in this case we use them to keep you engaged with education\n",
      "and even some examples of these techniques one of the most powerful ones is the notion of a streak what a streak is is is just a counter measures a number of days that you've used the proud of consecutive you just think that number you put a very prominently in your product and then people come back every day and the reason people come back every day is because\n",
      "well if they don't come back that number reset to zero and people don't want to lose district\n",
      "it works\n",
      "now on the one side streets have been criticised for for example getting teens addicted to snap chat but in the case of an educational map\n",
      "three get people to come back to study everyday\n",
      "not to give you an idea of the power of streaks in the case of duolingo we have over three million daily active users and have a streak longer than three hundred and sixty five\n",
      "that means they haven't missed the day in the last year or longer now on fact about streaks one country to getting has the longest average streets\n",
      "for an educational app\n",

      "of course\n",
      "shortest that restricts\n",
      "latin america maybe\n",
      "oh what fun a were fun\n",
      "another important mechanism to get people to come back to your product or notifications on the ones i notifications can be released on the and annoying but in the case of an educational product you will actually want to be reminded to learn and because of duolingo we have a very sophisticated ai system\n",
      "that basically choose this when to send the notification and also what to say in his notification to maximize the probability that people come back\n",
      "now interestingly even after all the sophistication it turns out that the algorithm for choosing what i'm to send your notification is pretty simple\n",
      "you know what is the best time to send people a notification i'll tell you it's twenty four hours after they use the brought up last\n",
      "because and there's an easy explanation if you are free yesterday at three pm you probably street today after be i'm as well\n",
      "and so this is what a very sophisticated millions of dollars of a i found\n",
      "funny\n",
      "now with notifications you shouldn't be spam and we're not spamming with duolingo actually stop sending notifications after seven days of and activities of you don't use duolingo for seven days we stopped and the you notifications not some point it occurred to us if we're stopping the send people don't have a good as we should let them know so i we started sending this notification two people saying it is a reminder\n",
      "seem to be working with stop sending them for now you know people do when they get this notification\n",
      "they come back\n",
      "passive aggressive\n",
      "worst for my mother works for developing a\n",
      "passive aggressive not i guess it's a really good up getting people to come back because they feel like are green our mascot has given up on them\n",
      "so they come back and speaking of a green our mascot by the way because all our notifications come from our green our mascot and well his passive aggressive and also pretty bushy this is given rise to a lot of names on the internet that make fun of just the great lengths that he will go through get you back to learn a language is one of my favorite ones this is it's a meme my favorite ones\n",
      "basically looks like you forgot your spanish lessons and then there's an intruder lend presumably the al broke into your house to give you learn language\n",
      "now duolingo has entered the decide guest and this this thousands of means there's some else gets about it and it's because we've managed to get people to want to learn a language by using the same techniques that\n",
      "mobile games and social media use to get people engaged and\n",
      "this is a really important point let me say this am\n",
      "i don't actually believe that there's a way to make an educational app yes engaging something like picked up where instagram or mobile games\n",
      "but the good news is that and by the way to the reason i don't believe that is because ultimately you have to teach people something and it's hard to compete with like cats and celebrities i'm but the good news is the i don't think you have to so here's the thing when you're learning something you get meaning out of it whereas when you're scrolling for two hours and instagram a lot of times afterwards if\n",
      "you're lucky you just wasted your time so i think it's actually okay if your educational product is only eighty or ninety percent as engaging or something like ticked off because the other ten or twenty percent will be provided by people's internal motivational though of course not much more than that\n",
      "this is really a key point if we want to get people to do something\n",
      "meaningful you can use the same techniques that apps like social media use to get people to do it and even if you're not as engaging as those apps are you can still get hundreds of millions of people to use your product in the case of duolingo for example there are more people learning languages on duolingo in the united states and there are people learning languages across all us high school\n",

      "she you know for the longest time didn't even speak in any of his videos but what he did was in the had talent he was funny he had a good expression he had creativity so we kept posting and today he has one hundred and sixty million followers on our platform so every single day we hear stories like that in a businesses people with talent and i think\n",

      "basically what this is his math in of course you know ai and machine learning has allowed this to be done at a very very big skill and what we have seen the result of this is that he learns the interest signals that people exhibit very quickly and shows you content is really relevant for you\n",
      "in a very in in a very quick way not so it's for it's a form of collaborative filtering from what you're saying that yes the theory behind it is the is humans a weird people we don't really know there's them but if if we see that one human is interested with an overlap of someone else chances are you know you can you can make use of the other pieces that are in that overlap\n",

      "i mean lots of\n",
      "startups have tried to use these these types of techniques i'm wondering what else played a role early on him and how how big a deal was a the from the get go you optimizing for smartphones so the videos was shot in for correct format and and they and they were short was that it was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered i think we would have first the really tried\n",
      "this scale you know the recommendation algorithm is a very important reason as to why the the perform is so popular occur among so many people are beyond that you mention\n",
      "the format of itself so we talked about the vision of the company which has to have a window to discover in if you sort of just up for the first time you see to it takes up your screen so does the window that we want you can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their lives then you know through this recommendation algorithm we have found it\n",
      "it connects people together people find communities and i've heard so many stories of people were found their communities because of the contended a posting now give you an example of\n",
      "i was in dc recently and i met with a bunch of creators i heard\n",

      "she started posting on this content on tick tock end up you know i saw his content in looks of i was hungry after looking at it's is great you know content in his generators so much interest in his business the last year he mean something like a million dollars in revenue\n",
      "just via tick tock one restaurant and in again and again a huge his stories by connecting people together by giving people the window to discover we have forgiven many small businesses and many people your common person a voice that it would never otherwise have and i think that's the power of the platform\n",
      "so you definitely have identified early just how in our social creatures we need affirmation i'm i've had a story and you can tell me whether true or not the one of the keys to your early lift off was that you want to persuade creators who are trying out tick tock that this was a platform where you know they would get whisper\n",
      "early on when you're trying to grow something in the numbers on that response so you had a brilliant idea of goosing those numbers a bit basically finding ways to give people you know a big a sense of lot more likes more engagement and was actually the case by using a i agent somehow in the in the process is is a brilliant idea is that are the\n",
      "just a myth i would\n",
      "i would i would describe it in a different way so the other platforms to exist they don't with before tick tock in if you think about this platforms you sort of have to be famous already in order to go followers because the we is build is that people come and follow people and if we don't if you aren't really famous the chances that you get discovered a very\n",
      "every law now what we have done again because of the difference in the we were recommended content is that we have given any one any single person with enough talent a speech to be able to be discovered in i think that actually is the single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform and again and again you will hear stories\n",
      "from people who use the platform or post regularly on it that if the have something you want to see the performed just them the chance and the stage to connect with the audience in a way that i think no other products in the past as ever offered them\n",
      "so i'm i'm just trying to play back what what use what you said they you said you were describing their differ way what i what i said is is it that in the case that like to give someone a decent chance someone who's brilliant but doesn't come with any follow as initially that you you have you got some technique to identify talent and that you will you will almost encourage them you will you will give them some guy\n",
      "and of from artificially increase the number of followers were like so whatever that they have so the others are encouraged to go wow there's something there and so forth like it's this idea of critical mass that kind of every entrepreneur every party planner kind of those about of the know this is the hot place in town everyone calm and that that is how you actually game critical mass we we wanted\n",
      "sure that every person who posts a video is given and an equal chance to be able to have some audience to begin with but this idea that you are the media alluding to that we can get people to like something it doesn't really work like that you don't then you get could you get a i agents to like something for you see the network way\n",
      "with extra and for could kind of get you know give give someone early encouragement ultimately what the machine does is he recognizes people's interests so if you post something that's not interesting though a lot of people even if you gave it a lot of exposure you're not going to get of morality that you what whereas come so is is a lot of you know there's no\n",

      "and want to give you all some suggestions for things you can do starting right now to experience it's power for yourself\n",
      "so the first thing we need to start with i am is the fact that fun is a feeling and it's not an activity and it's important because a lotta times when i ask people what's fun though respond with a list of activities that they enjoyed you know the same dancing is fun or scheme as finer i don't know pickle ball is fine\n",
      "everyone seems to think that pickle ball is fun\n",
      "and assure people can be fun but we've all had experiences were something's off and an activity that seems like it would be fun doesn't end up feeling fun\n",
      "and then on the flipside we've had experiences were something that doesn't seem like would be fun at all and the feeling ridiculously fun is an element of serendipity it when people do have fun when they experienced this feeling it's actually very easy to recognize because people who are having fun look like they're being illuminated from within\n",
      "so for example here's me and my husband having fun together\n",
      "here's some president's having fun together\n",
      "here's archbishop desmond tutu and the dalai lama having fun together\n",
      "actually those to seem like they were very often even constantly\n",
      "having fun together\n",
      "and as you can see in these photographs true fun produces this visceral sense of lightness and joy\n",
      "it's radiant and fact when i asked my daughter when she was about five years old what color fun would be she said sunshine\n",
      "so what is the sunshine you know what is this feeling that we call fun but when people tell me their stories about fun it's really interesting because the details are all different and often quite mundane but the energy running through them as the same and there are three factors that are consistently present to the point that i believe they constitute a new definition one that is a lot more\n",
      "accurate than what's in the dictionary and those three factors are playfulness connection and flow\n",
      "so by playfulness i do not mean you have to play games or god forbid make believe i just me having a light hearted attitude of doing things for the sake of doing them and not carrying too much about the outcome letting go of perfectionism when we have fun or guard is down and we're not taking ourselves too seriously\n",
      "connection or for the feeling of having a special shared experience and i do think it's possible in some circumstances to have fun alone and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings are the activity but the majority of stories of people tell me about their peak fond memories another person is involved and that's true even for interviews\n",
      "it's\n",
      "and then flow is the state where we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time you can think about an athlete little the game or like a musician plane a piece of music it's when we're in the zone\n",
      "is possible to be in flow and not have fun like if you're arguing but you cannot have fun if you're not in flow\n",
      "so playful is cash inflow all feel great on their own but when we experience all three at once something magical happens we have fun\n",
      "and that doesn't just feel good it is good for us and fact fund us so many amazingly good things for us that i personally believe that fun is not just the result of human thriving it's a cause\n",
      "so for example fun is energizing\n",
      "when people tell me their stories about fun they glow it is like a fire has been lit inside of them in the energy and the warmth of they give off is contagious\n",
      "you know so much of life drains us but fun fills us up\n",
      "fun also makes us present a lot of us put a lotta work and a trying to be more present you know we do yoga classes we meditate and that is all great or the fact that fun as a flow state means that when we're having fun we simply are present there's no other way for to happen\n",
      "fun also unites us we live in a really polar as worlds and as we whole know there's a lot of very serious problems but when we have fun with people we don't see them as different political parties or nationalities are religions reconnect with them as human beings it's worth noting that that is the first step and been able to work together\n",
      "to solve those problems\n",
      "fun also makes us healthier now being lonely and stressed out as many of us have been for the past two years causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease but when we have fun relaxed and were more socially connected both of which have the opposite effect\n",
      "so kind of blows my mind every time i think about it this way but having fun is a health intervention\n",
      "and then lastly fun is joyful in it we all so desperately want to be happy we read books about happiness we download apps buy happiness but when we are in a moment of having fun we are happy\n",
      "so makes me think that perhaps the secret to long term happiness is just to have more everyday moments of fun\n",
      "so how do we do that how do we have more fun well to start with do not take the suggestions you'll find a magazine articles about how to have more fun so i'll i looked up some of these myself when i found suggestions that include are not is up\n",
      "roasted turkey\n",
      "put together an altar to loved ones who have passed\n",
      "watch a documentary about climates\n",
      "and my personal favorite a during your table with gourds\n",
      "so go\n",
      "those are not good suggestions\n",
      "instead the most effective thing you can do to have more fun is to focus on it's ingredients are which i mean do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness connection and flow so here's my ideas for how to do so so to star with reduced distractions and order to increase flow anything that distracts you is going to kick you out to flow and prevent you from having\n",
      "fun\n",
      "and what's the number one source of distraction for most of us these days\n",
      "oh thank you\n",
      "a for target but yes your phones\n",
      "now i wrote a book called how to break up with your phone so i have strong feelings about this but i can guarantee you that you're not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone so today i want to challenge you to keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible so the you can take me up my second suggestion which is to increase connection by interacting more with other human being\n",
      "in real life\n",
      "now i know that one of the main reasons were causally on our phones is specifically to avoid having to spend time and interact with other human beings in real life\n",
      "so i want to assure you that it is worth it and it is not as hard as it might seem so here's how you do it you start by making eye contact with someone like look them in the i don't look like in the middle their forehead where the camera would be on a zoom call or\n",
      "and you say hello\n",

      "are we also the most nice and often generic to the people around us\n",
      "i'm a social psychologists and i've been studying the science of uncomfortable social interactions for over twenty years so everything from new roommate relationships negotiations upward feedback with your boss to doctor patient interactions those moments where you need a break in and say your for the last twenty minutes actually have no idea what you are talking\n",
      "about can we may be rewind to bed and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback\n",
      "second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with her hair doodling then and even tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control are under the skin responses are physiology\n",
      "g r cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate he's types of things that we often don't even really realize that we're feeling and the way i do this is by having people commented lab and interact with each other and a bunch of different settings\n",
      "and i have them negotiate with each other a had them get acquainted with each other and often it's the case the in these interactions people are required to give some form of feedback to their partner tell them honestly whether thinking or feeling common with an offer for negotiation tell them what they could have done better next time\n",
      "and i think we all can you know what it feels like to be him when he studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there's a lot of equipment involved and but we plug people are tall of these things to measure these under the skin response as be video tape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned not a get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward\n",
      "maybe potentially little bit nice and want you want to think about what was the last awkward interaction the you had a so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments\n",
      "because in a couple minutes i'm actually gonna randomly call on someone based on your seats to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like\n",
      "so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first twenty seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned the heart rate goes\n",
      "up their blood pressure increases it doesn't take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it and those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who's sitting next to them in an just to get a little bit more distance\n",
      "one of my favorite findings isn't doctor patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more are they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with his patients\n",
      "so let's all return to your awkward moment is everyone have an awkward moment in mind when thinking about when\n",
      "how many of you have i increases in your heart rate maybe palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just the mere thought of being called upon today\n",
      "ag a few of you may be what are seeks be excited about that opportunity not and okay same people could pick\n",
      "how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grant through gritty greeted t like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time\n",
      "a few the of door am not going to actually do this and this was all just a ruse to teach a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often don't have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable\n",
      "no one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major from and i brought people together who are used to working with one another\n",
      "and we had him engage in a negotiation and at the end of it there was a winner in there was a loser\n",
      "so he said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential miss stops how many of you think that that's what they actually did they really followed are instructions\n",
      "hey nobody can see where this is going\n",
      "what we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to as we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you me that really early offer and didn't even ask for counter i was amazing or it was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change\n",
      "on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are\n",
      "so often these kinds of interactions the take the form of what i'll call anxious niceness and they involve lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general non specific way\n",
      "but a lot of work actually looks at what's what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of riddles smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering\n",
      "a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of\n",
      "and that anxiety is regulated by being over the top nice to these folks\n",
      "we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronize to and attentive to the how we say a peace than the what we say part someone once teddy we had black and white americans interact with each other in across race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measure the physiology of both partners\n",
      "what this allowed us to do is captured the degree to which people stress those under the skin responses can actually be caught by their partners\n",
      "and what we expect to define is that the black participants will become more synchronize physiologically to those whites the be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that's exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared for the fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol sorry\n",
      "activity indicating some real deep and of under the skin stress response the more those by participants became linked up to them over time\n",
      "and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress in our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always or owner physiology is not always around and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress a good\n",
      "negatively affect your body's\n",
      "no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you\n",
      "need to stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context\n",
      "so imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls me be passed employee recruiter cause you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things are going to put are gonna be like there are real team player they have great energy at work generic things\n",
      "yes there are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves while they must not really know this person at all or even know what this means at worst they think to themselves where they probably have some real opinions they're just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive fee\n",
      "back kinda actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data\n",
      "so i think we have didn't think about what is the solution to this problem is is the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i don't think that's the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i'm in a highly three of them to improve the degree to which we get clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace\n",
      "so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with his niceness culture really there's a bit of a plural ignorance the goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work am what i've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback\n",
      "there's another person who feels like it's lazy you feel like it's not helpful and i actually learned this lesson the hard way from one of my students recently she was giving our practice talk in my lab and she spent weeks and weeks preparing it on\n",

      "on the other hand most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone and the trend is that a fraction is only going to increase so we decided that the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone and then we call it duolingo\n",
      "now in order to truly be accessible to everyone rich and poor duolingo used as a freemium model to support itself\n",
      "that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay\n",
      "but if you don't pay you may have to see an ad at the end of a lesson\n",
      "and if you don't like ads you can also paid to describe the turn of the ads\n",
      "and it turns out that the vast majority of the revenue for duolingo comes from people to pay described to turn of the ass\n",
      "and now for these people who pay to suspend the turn of the as well they're usually people that well off people in rich countries like the us and canada who are the people who don't pay does as by be usually come from poorer countries like brazil or vietnam or one ammo\n",
      "what i like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically a rich people to pay for the occasion education of everyone so i like that\n",
      "it's a great so with smartphones we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people to pay for the whole thing spread however if you're trying to deliver education with a smartphone you run into a humongous problem\n",
      "and it is that smartphones comic but with some of the most i forgive drugs to humanity has engineered it doctor instagram mobile games\n",
      "seat delivering education of our smartphone is like hoping that people will eat your broccoli or right next to it you put the most delicious dessert ever made\n",

      "and we do willing we've been able to do this and at the highest level the where we've done this is by making the broccoli there's like desert\n",
      "i say it another way what we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that\n",
      "apps like instagram up or mobile games used to keep people engaged in this case we use them to keep you engaged with education\n",
      "and even some examples of these techniques one of the most powerful ones is the notion of a streak what a streak is is is just a counter measures a number of days that you've used the proud of consecutive you just think that number you put a very prominently in your product and then people come back every day and the reason people come back every day is because\n",
      "well if they don't come back that number reset to zero and people don't want to lose district\n",

      "another important mechanism to get people to come back to your product or notifications on the ones i notifications can be released on the and annoying but in the case of an educational product you will actually want to be reminded to learn and because of duolingo we have a very sophisticated ai system\n",
      "that basically choose this when to send the notification and also what to say in his notification to maximize the probability that people come back\n",
      "now interestingly even after all the sophistication it turns out that the algorithm for choosing what i'm to send your notification is pretty simple\n",
      "you know what is the best time to send people a notification i'll tell you it's twenty four hours after they use the brought up last\n",

      "this is a really important point let me say this am\n",
      "i don't actually believe that there's a way to make an educational app yes engaging something like picked up where instagram or mobile games\n",
      "but the good news is that and by the way to the reason i don't believe that is because ultimately you have to teach people something and it's hard to compete with like cats and celebrities i'm but the good news is the i don't think you have to so here's the thing when you're learning something you get meaning out of it whereas when you're scrolling for two hours and instagram a lot of times afterwards if\n",
      "you're lucky you just wasted your time so i think it's actually okay if your educational product is only eighty or ninety percent as engaging or something like ticked off because the other ten or twenty percent will be provided by people's internal motivational though of course not much more than that\n",
      "this is really a key point if we want to get people to do something\n",
      "meaningful you can use the same techniques that apps like social media use to get people to do it and even if you're not as engaging as those apps are you can still get hundreds of millions of people to use your product in the case of duolingo for example there are more people learning languages on duolingo in the united states and there are people learning languages across all us high school\n",

      "search you know there was an app that was built for people who wanted to search things that was eaten took the saudis more easily the serve found and then in the era of social graphs it was about connecting people enough followers not what we have done is that we are based on ah machine learning algorithms were showing people what they like and what this means is\n",
      "we have given the everyday person a platform to be discovered if you have talent it is very very easy to get discovered on tick tock and i'll just give you one one example of this the biggest create on tick tock is a guy called copy\n",

      "she you know for the longest time didn't even speak in any of his videos but what he did was in the had talent he was funny he had a good expression he had creativity so we kept posting and today he has one hundred and sixty million followers on our platform so every single day we hear stories like that in a businesses people with talent and i think\n",

      "like many of your creators so so the that that these algorithms by just by observing people's behavior what they look like have discovered things that thousands of believe humans never discovered tell me some of the things that it is looking at so obvious things like have some presses like or stay\n",

      "what if you like videos one two three and four and i like videos one two three and five maybe he liked videos one two three and six know what's gonna happen is because we like one two three yeah the same time he's going to be shown four five six and so army and you can thing about this repeated at skill in real time across more than a billion people sp\n",
      "basically what this is his math in of course you know ai and machine learning has allowed this to be done at a very very big skill and what we have seen the result of this is that he learns the interest signals that people exhibit very quickly and shows you content is really relevant for you\n",
      "in a very in in a very quick way not so it's for it's a form of collaborative filtering from what you're saying that yes the theory behind it is the is humans a weird people we don't really know there's them but if if we see that one human is interested with an overlap of someone else chances are you know you can you can make use of the other pieces that are in that overlap\n",
      "humans repertoire to to to feed feed them and they'll be surprised but the reason they like it is because their power also like that it's his pattern recognition based on your interest signals and i think the other thing here is that we don't actually ask you twenty questions on whether you like a piece of content you know what are your interest we don't do that we\n",
      "built that experience organically into the of experience so you're voting with a thumbs in know by watching a video you know by citing it by liking it by sharing it you're basically exhibiting interest signals and what it does and a medically is a take those signals put in a formula and a matches it through pattern recognition that's basically the\n",
      "idea behind it\n",
      "i mean lots of\n",
      "startups have tried to use these these types of techniques i'm wondering what else played a role early on him and how how big a deal was a the from the get go you optimizing for smartphones so the videos was shot in for correct format and and they and they were short was that it was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered i think we would have first the really tried\n",
      "this scale you know the recommendation algorithm is a very important reason as to why the the perform is so popular occur among so many people are beyond that you mention\n",
      "the format of itself so we talked about the vision of the company which has to have a window to discover in if you sort of just up for the first time you see to it takes up your screen so does the window that we want you can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their lives then you know through this recommendation algorithm we have found it\n",
      "it connects people together people find communities and i've heard so many stories of people were found their communities because of the contended a posting now give you an example of\n",
      "i was in dc recently and i met with a bunch of creators i heard\n",

      "she started posting on this content on tick tock end up you know i saw his content in looks of i was hungry after looking at it's is great you know content in his generators so much interest in his business the last year he mean something like a million dollars in revenue\n",
      "just via tick tock one restaurant and in again and again a huge his stories by connecting people together by giving people the window to discover we have forgiven many small businesses and many people your common person a voice that it would never otherwise have and i think that's the power of the platform\n",
      "so you definitely have identified early just how in our social creatures we need affirmation i'm i've had a story and you can tell me whether true or not the one of the keys to your early lift off was that you want to persuade creators who are trying out tick tock that this was a platform where you know they would get whisper\n",

      "just a myth i would\n",
      "i would i would describe it in a different way so the other platforms to exist they don't with before tick tock in if you think about this platforms you sort of have to be famous already in order to go followers because the we is build is that people come and follow people and if we don't if you aren't really famous the chances that you get discovered a very\n",
      "every law now what we have done again because of the difference in the we were recommended content is that we have given any one any single person with enough talent a speech to be able to be discovered in i think that actually is the single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform and again and again you will hear stories\n",
      "from people who use the platform or post regularly on it that if the have something you want to see the performed just them the chance and the stage to connect with the audience in a way that i think no other products in the past as ever offered them\n",
      "so i'm i'm just trying to play back what what use what you said they you said you were describing their differ way what i what i said is is it that in the case that like to give someone a decent chance someone who's brilliant but doesn't come with any follow as initially that you you have you got some technique to identify talent and that you will you will almost encourage them you will you will give them some guy\n",
      "and of from artificially increase the number of followers were like so whatever that they have so the others are encouraged to go wow there's something there and so forth like it's this idea of critical mass that kind of every entrepreneur every party planner kind of those about of the know this is the hot place in town everyone calm and that that is how you actually game critical mass we we wanted\n",
      "sure that every person who posts a video is given and an equal chance to be able to have some audience to begin with but this idea that you are the media alluding to that we can get people to like something it doesn't really work like that you don't then you get could you get a i agents to like something for you see the network way\n",
      "with extra and for could kind of get you know give give someone early encouragement ultimately what the machine does is he recognizes people's interests so if you post something that's not interesting though a lot of people even if you gave it a lot of exposure you're not going to get of morality that you what whereas come so is is a lot of you know there's no\n",

      "then it seems like it should be\n",
      "actually feeling alive\n",
      "and when i mean by that is that we all constantly doing release were constantly scrolling\n",
      "but we're not necessarily living you know we keep ourselves busy to the point of exhaustion or were also languishing in feel a little bit that inside\n",
      "i think we know that on some level i think that's part of the reason we keep ourselves so busy and distracted to begin with but we don't know what to do about it\n",
      "so i am here to tell you i figured out what to do about it\n",
      "we need to have more fun\n",
      "so you might think that you're already having plenty of fun and that's because in our everyday speech we often use the word fun to describe anything we do have our leisure time even if it's not actually enjoyable and in fact a waste of time servers\n",
      "so for example we scroll through social media for fun even though doing so often makes us feel bad about like kind of everything or will say there was so fun we should do that again soon and respect\n",
      "in response to things they worried that fun and that we don't want to do again\n",
      "ever\n",
      "but it's not really our father were a little bit sloppy about how we use the word fun because even the dictionary doesn't get a quite right you know it says that fine as an amusement or enjoyment or light hearted pleasure it's a me for kids to have him play areas it makes it sound like it's frivolous and optional\n",
      "but if you think back on your own memories that stand out to you as having truly been fine and i really encourage you to do this year the memories that you would describe as and forgive me for i scientific terminology so fun\n",
      "you're going to notice that there's something much deeper going on\n",
      "i've collected thousands of these stories from people all around the world and i can tell you it's amazing because when people were count the memories in which they had the most fun\n",
      "they tell you about some of the most joyful and treasured memories of their lives\n",
      "so in reality fun is not just light hearted pleasure\n",
      "it's not just for kids and it is definitely not frivolous instead fun as the secrets of feeling alive\n",
      "so today i want to propose to a new more precise definition of what fun is i want to reveal some of the ways in which it is astonishingly good for us\n",
      "and want to give you all some suggestions for things you can do starting right now to experience it's power for yourself\n",
      "so the first thing we need to start with i am is the fact that fun is a feeling and it's not an activity and it's important because a lotta times when i ask people what's fun though respond with a list of activities that they enjoyed you know the same dancing is fun or scheme as finer i don't know pickle ball is fine\n",
      "everyone seems to think that pickle ball is fun\n",
      "and assure people can be fun but we've all had experiences were something's off and an activity that seems like it would be fun doesn't end up feeling fun\n",
      "and then on the flipside we've had experiences were something that doesn't seem like would be fun at all and the feeling ridiculously fun is an element of serendipity it when people do have fun when they experienced this feeling it's actually very easy to recognize because people who are having fun look like they're being illuminated from within\n",
      "so for example here's me and my husband having fun together\n",
      "here's some president's having fun together\n",
      "here's archbishop desmond tutu and the dalai lama having fun together\n",
      "actually those to seem like they were very often even constantly\n",
      "having fun together\n",
      "and as you can see in these photographs true fun produces this visceral sense of lightness and joy\n",
      "it's radiant and fact when i asked my daughter when she was about five years old what color fun would be she said sunshine\n",
      "so what is the sunshine you know what is this feeling that we call fun but when people tell me their stories about fun it's really interesting because the details are all different and often quite mundane but the energy running through them as the same and there are three factors that are consistently present to the point that i believe they constitute a new definition one that is a lot more\n",
      "accurate than what's in the dictionary and those three factors are playfulness connection and flow\n",
      "so by playfulness i do not mean you have to play games or god forbid make believe i just me having a light hearted attitude of doing things for the sake of doing them and not carrying too much about the outcome letting go of perfectionism when we have fun or guard is down and we're not taking ourselves too seriously\n",
      "connection or for the feeling of having a special shared experience and i do think it's possible in some circumstances to have fun alone and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings are the activity but the majority of stories of people tell me about their peak fond memories another person is involved and that's true even for interviews\n",
      "it's\n",
      "and then flow is the state where we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time you can think about an athlete little the game or like a musician plane a piece of music it's when we're in the zone\n",
      "is possible to be in flow and not have fun like if you're arguing but you cannot have fun if you're not in flow\n",
      "so playful is cash inflow all feel great on their own but when we experience all three at once something magical happens we have fun\n",
      "and that doesn't just feel good it is good for us and fact fund us so many amazingly good things for us that i personally believe that fun is not just the result of human thriving it's a cause\n",
      "so for example fun is energizing\n",
      "when people tell me their stories about fun they glow it is like a fire has been lit inside of them in the energy and the warmth of they give off is contagious\n",
      "you know so much of life drains us but fun fills us up\n",
      "fun also makes us present a lot of us put a lotta work and a trying to be more present you know we do yoga classes we meditate and that is all great or the fact that fun as a flow state means that when we're having fun we simply are present there's no other way for to happen\n",
      "fun also unites us we live in a really polar as worlds and as we whole know there's a lot of very serious problems but when we have fun with people we don't see them as different political parties or nationalities are religions reconnect with them as human beings it's worth noting that that is the first step and been able to work together\n",
      "to solve those problems\n",
      "fun also makes us healthier now being lonely and stressed out as many of us have been for the past two years causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease but when we have fun relaxed and were more socially connected both of which have the opposite effect\n",
      "so kind of blows my mind every time i think about it this way but having fun is a health intervention\n",
      "and then lastly fun is joyful in it we all so desperately want to be happy we read books about happiness we download apps buy happiness but when we are in a moment of having fun we are happy\n",
      "so makes me think that perhaps the secret to long term happiness is just to have more everyday moments of fun\n",
      "so how do we do that how do we have more fun well to start with do not take the suggestions you'll find a magazine articles about how to have more fun so i'll i looked up some of these myself when i found suggestions that include are not is up\n",
      "roasted turkey\n",
      "put together an altar to loved ones who have passed\n",
      "watch a documentary about climates\n",
      "and my personal favorite a during your table with gourds\n",
      "so go\n",
      "those are not good suggestions\n",
      "instead the most effective thing you can do to have more fun is to focus on it's ingredients are which i mean do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness connection and flow so here's my ideas for how to do so so to star with reduced distractions and order to increase flow anything that distracts you is going to kick you out to flow and prevent you from having\n",
      "fun\n",
      "and what's the number one source of distraction for most of us these days\n",
      "oh thank you\n",
      "a for target but yes your phones\n",
      "now i wrote a book called how to break up with your phone so i have strong feelings about this but i can guarantee you that you're not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone so today i want to challenge you to keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible so the you can take me up my second suggestion which is to increase connection by interacting more with other human being\n",
      "in real life\n",
      "now i know that one of the main reasons were causally on our phones is specifically to avoid having to spend time and interact with other human beings in real life\n",
      "so i want to assure you that it is worth it and it is not as hard as it might seem so here's how you do it you start by making eye contact with someone like look them in the i don't look like in the middle their forehead where the camera would be on a zoom call or\n",
      "and you say hello\n",

      "the case that when we're feeling the most anxious uncomfortable socially awkward versions of ourselves when our hearts are pounding and are palms are sweating and me feel a crawling out of our skin\n",
      "are we also the most nice and often generic to the people around us\n",
      "i'm a social psychologists and i've been studying the science of uncomfortable social interactions for over twenty years so everything from new roommate relationships negotiations upward feedback with your boss to doctor patient interactions those moments where you need a break in and say your for the last twenty minutes actually have no idea what you are talking\n",
      "about can we may be rewind to bed and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback\n",
      "second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with her hair doodling then and even tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control are under the skin responses are physiology\n",
      "g r cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate he's types of things that we often don't even really realize that we're feeling and the way i do this is by having people commented lab and interact with each other and a bunch of different settings\n",
      "and i have them negotiate with each other a had them get acquainted with each other and often it's the case the in these interactions people are required to give some form of feedback to their partner tell them honestly whether thinking or feeling common with an offer for negotiation tell them what they could have done better next time\n",
      "and i think we all can you know what it feels like to be him when he studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there's a lot of equipment involved and but we plug people are tall of these things to measure these under the skin response as be video tape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned not a get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward\n",
      "maybe potentially little bit nice and want you want to think about what was the last awkward interaction the you had a so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments\n",
      "because in a couple minutes i'm actually gonna randomly call on someone based on your seats to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like\n",
      "so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first twenty seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned the heart rate goes\n",
      "up their blood pressure increases it doesn't take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it and those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who's sitting next to them in an just to get a little bit more distance\n",
      "one of my favorite findings isn't doctor patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more are they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with his patients\n",
      "so let's all return to your awkward moment is everyone have an awkward moment in mind when thinking about when\n",
      "how many of you have i increases in your heart rate maybe palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just the mere thought of being called upon today\n",
      "ag a few of you may be what are seeks be excited about that opportunity not and okay same people could pick\n",
      "how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grant through gritty greeted t like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time\n",
      "a few the of door am not going to actually do this and this was all just a ruse to teach a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often don't have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable\n",
      "no one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major from and i brought people together who are used to working with one another\n",
      "and we had him engage in a negotiation and at the end of it there was a winner in there was a loser\n",
      "so he said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential miss stops how many of you think that that's what they actually did they really followed are instructions\n",
      "hey nobody can see where this is going\n",
      "what we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to as we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you me that really early offer and didn't even ask for counter i was amazing or it was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change\n",
      "on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are\n",
      "so often these kinds of interactions the take the form of what i'll call anxious niceness and they involve lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general non specific way\n",
      "but a lot of work actually looks at what's what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of riddles smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering\n",
      "a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of\n",
      "and that anxiety is regulated by being over the top nice to these folks\n",
      "we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronize to and attentive to the how we say a peace than the what we say part someone once teddy we had black and white americans interact with each other in across race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measure the physiology of both partners\n",
      "what this allowed us to do is captured the degree to which people stress those under the skin responses can actually be caught by their partners\n",
      "and what we expect to define is that the black participants will become more synchronize physiologically to those whites the be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that's exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared for the fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol sorry\n",
      "activity indicating some real deep and of under the skin stress response the more those by participants became linked up to them over time\n",
      "and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress in our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always or owner physiology is not always around and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress a good\n",
      "negatively affect your body's\n",
      "no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you\n",
      "need to stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context\n",
      "so imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls me be passed employee recruiter cause you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things are going to put are gonna be like there are real team player they have great energy at work generic things\n",
      "yes there are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves while they must not really know this person at all or even know what this means at worst they think to themselves where they probably have some real opinions they're just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive fee\n",
      "back kinda actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data\n",
      "so i think we have didn't think about what is the solution to this problem is is the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i don't think that's the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i'm in a highly three of them to improve the degree to which we get clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace\n",
      "so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with his niceness culture really there's a bit of a plural ignorance the goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work am what i've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback\n",

      "search you know there was an app that was built for people who wanted to search things that was eaten took the saudis more easily the serve found and then in the era of social graphs it was about connecting people enough followers not what we have done is that we are based on ah machine learning algorithms were showing people what they like and what this means is\n",
      "we have given the everyday person a platform to be discovered if you have talent it is very very easy to get discovered on tick tock and i'll just give you one one example of this the biggest create on tick tock is a guy called copy\n",

      "she you know for the longest time didn't even speak in any of his videos but what he did was in the had talent he was funny he had a good expression he had creativity so we kept posting and today he has one hundred and sixty million followers on our platform so every single day we hear stories like that in a businesses people with talent and i think\n",

      "so this is this is the amazing thing to me like we must have a have grown grown up with say network television for were for decades you've had thousands of brilliant creative people calling in the trenches trying to imagine stuff that will be amazing for an audience and none of them ever remotely came up with anything that know\n",
      "like many of your creators so so the that that these algorithms by just by observing people's behavior what they look like have discovered things that thousands of believe humans never discovered tell me some of the things that it is looking at so obvious things like have some presses like or stay\n",

      "what if you like videos one two three and four and i like videos one two three and five maybe he liked videos one two three and six know what's gonna happen is because we like one two three yeah the same time he's going to be shown four five six and so army and you can thing about this repeated at skill in real time across more than a billion people sp\n",
      "basically what this is his math in of course you know ai and machine learning has allowed this to be done at a very very big skill and what we have seen the result of this is that he learns the interest signals that people exhibit very quickly and shows you content is really relevant for you\n",
      "in a very in in a very quick way not so it's for it's a form of collaborative filtering from what you're saying that yes the theory behind it is the is humans a weird people we don't really know there's them but if if we see that one human is interested with an overlap of someone else chances are you know you can you can make use of the other pieces that are in that overlap\n",
      "humans repertoire to to to feed feed them and they'll be surprised but the reason they like it is because their power also like that it's his pattern recognition based on your interest signals and i think the other thing here is that we don't actually ask you twenty questions on whether you like a piece of content you know what are your interest we don't do that we\n",
      "built that experience organically into the of experience so you're voting with a thumbs in know by watching a video you know by citing it by liking it by sharing it you're basically exhibiting interest signals and what it does and a medically is a take those signals put in a formula and a matches it through pattern recognition that's basically the\n",
      "idea behind it\n",
      "i mean lots of\n",
      "startups have tried to use these these types of techniques i'm wondering what else played a role early on him and how how big a deal was a the from the get go you optimizing for smartphones so the videos was shot in for correct format and and they and they were short was that it was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered i think we would have first the really tried\n",
      "this scale you know the recommendation algorithm is a very important reason as to why the the perform is so popular occur among so many people are beyond that you mention\n",
      "the format of itself so we talked about the vision of the company which has to have a window to discover in if you sort of just up for the first time you see to it takes up your screen so does the window that we want you can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their lives then you know through this recommendation algorithm we have found it\n",
      "it connects people together people find communities and i've heard so many stories of people were found their communities because of the contended a posting now give you an example of\n",
      "i was in dc recently and i met with a bunch of creators i heard\n",

      "just via tick tock one restaurant and in again and again a huge his stories by connecting people together by giving people the window to discover we have forgiven many small businesses and many people your common person a voice that it would never otherwise have and i think that's the power of the platform\n",

      "i would i would describe it in a different way so the other platforms to exist they don't with before tick tock in if you think about this platforms you sort of have to be famous already in order to go followers because the we is build is that people come and follow people and if we don't if you aren't really famous the chances that you get discovered a very\n",
      "every law now what we have done again because of the difference in the we were recommended content is that we have given any one any single person with enough talent a speech to be able to be discovered in i think that actually is the single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform and again and again you will hear stories\n",
      "from people who use the platform or post regularly on it that if the have something you want to see the performed just them the chance and the stage to connect with the audience in a way that i think no other products in the past as ever offered them\n",
      "so i'm i'm just trying to play back what what use what you said they you said you were describing their differ way what i what i said is is it that in the case that like to give someone a decent chance someone who's brilliant but doesn't come with any follow as initially that you you have you got some technique to identify talent and that you will you will almost encourage them you will you will give them some guy\n",
      "and of from artificially increase the number of followers were like so whatever that they have so the others are encouraged to go wow there's something there and so forth like it's this idea of critical mass that kind of every entrepreneur every party planner kind of those about of the know this is the hot place in town everyone calm and that that is how you actually game critical mass we we wanted\n",
      "sure that every person who posts a video is given and an equal chance to be able to have some audience to begin with but this idea that you are the media alluding to that we can get people to like something it doesn't really work like that you don't then you get could you get a i agents to like something for you see the network way\n",

      "so the first thing we need to start with i am is the fact that fun is a feeling and it's not an activity and it's important because a lotta times when i ask people what's fun though respond with a list of activities that they enjoyed you know the same dancing is fun or scheme as finer i don't know pickle ball is fine\n",
      "everyone seems to think that pickle ball is fun\n",
      "and assure people can be fun but we've all had experiences were something's off and an activity that seems like it would be fun doesn't end up feeling fun\n",
      "and then on the flipside we've had experiences were something that doesn't seem like would be fun at all and the feeling ridiculously fun is an element of serendipity it when people do have fun when they experienced this feeling it's actually very easy to recognize because people who are having fun look like they're being illuminated from within\n",
      "so for example here's me and my husband having fun together\n",
      "here's some president's having fun together\n",
      "here's archbishop desmond tutu and the dalai lama having fun together\n",
      "actually those to seem like they were very often even constantly\n",
      "having fun together\n",
      "and as you can see in these photographs true fun produces this visceral sense of lightness and joy\n",
      "it's radiant and fact when i asked my daughter when she was about five years old what color fun would be she said sunshine\n",
      "so what is the sunshine you know what is this feeling that we call fun but when people tell me their stories about fun it's really interesting because the details are all different and often quite mundane but the energy running through them as the same and there are three factors that are consistently present to the point that i believe they constitute a new definition one that is a lot more\n",
      "accurate than what's in the dictionary and those three factors are playfulness connection and flow\n",
      "so by playfulness i do not mean you have to play games or god forbid make believe i just me having a light hearted attitude of doing things for the sake of doing them and not carrying too much about the outcome letting go of perfectionism when we have fun or guard is down and we're not taking ourselves too seriously\n",
      "connection or for the feeling of having a special shared experience and i do think it's possible in some circumstances to have fun alone and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings are the activity but the majority of stories of people tell me about their peak fond memories another person is involved and that's true even for interviews\n",
      "it's\n",
      "and then flow is the state where we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time you can think about an athlete little the game or like a musician plane a piece of music it's when we're in the zone\n",
      "is possible to be in flow and not have fun like if you're arguing but you cannot have fun if you're not in flow\n",
      "so playful is cash inflow all feel great on their own but when we experience all three at once something magical happens we have fun\n",
      "and that doesn't just feel good it is good for us and fact fund us so many amazingly good things for us that i personally believe that fun is not just the result of human thriving it's a cause\n",
      "so for example fun is energizing\n",
      "when people tell me their stories about fun they glow it is like a fire has been lit inside of them in the energy and the warmth of they give off is contagious\n",
      "you know so much of life drains us but fun fills us up\n",
      "fun also makes us present a lot of us put a lotta work and a trying to be more present you know we do yoga classes we meditate and that is all great or the fact that fun as a flow state means that when we're having fun we simply are present there's no other way for to happen\n",
      "fun also unites us we live in a really polar as worlds and as we whole know there's a lot of very serious problems but when we have fun with people we don't see them as different political parties or nationalities are religions reconnect with them as human beings it's worth noting that that is the first step and been able to work together\n",
      "to solve those problems\n",
      "fun also makes us healthier now being lonely and stressed out as many of us have been for the past two years causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease but when we have fun relaxed and were more socially connected both of which have the opposite effect\n",
      "so kind of blows my mind every time i think about it this way but having fun is a health intervention\n",
      "and then lastly fun is joyful in it we all so desperately want to be happy we read books about happiness we download apps buy happiness but when we are in a moment of having fun we are happy\n",
      "so makes me think that perhaps the secret to long term happiness is just to have more everyday moments of fun\n",
      "so how do we do that how do we have more fun well to start with do not take the suggestions you'll find a magazine articles about how to have more fun so i'll i looked up some of these myself when i found suggestions that include are not is up\n",
      "roasted turkey\n",
      "put together an altar to loved ones who have passed\n",
      "watch a documentary about climates\n",
      "and my personal favorite a during your table with gourds\n",
      "so go\n",
      "those are not good suggestions\n",
      "instead the most effective thing you can do to have more fun is to focus on it's ingredients are which i mean do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness connection and flow so here's my ideas for how to do so so to star with reduced distractions and order to increase flow anything that distracts you is going to kick you out to flow and prevent you from having\n",
      "fun\n",
      "and what's the number one source of distraction for most of us these days\n",
      "oh thank you\n",
      "a for target but yes your phones\n",
      "now i wrote a book called how to break up with your phone so i have strong feelings about this but i can guarantee you that you're not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone so today i want to challenge you to keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible so the you can take me up my second suggestion which is to increase connection by interacting more with other human being\n",
      "in real life\n",
      "now i know that one of the main reasons were causally on our phones is specifically to avoid having to spend time and interact with other human beings in real life\n",
      "so i want to assure you that it is worth it and it is not as hard as it might seem so here's how you do it you start by making eye contact with someone like look them in the i don't look like in the middle their forehead where the camera would be on a zoom call or\n",
      "and you say hello\n",
      "and if that goes well you can introduce yourself\n",
      "and if that goes well maybe you can ask a question me\n",

      "how many of you have i increases in your heart rate maybe palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just the mere thought of being called upon today\n",
      "ag a few of you may be what are seeks be excited about that opportunity not and okay same people could pick\n",
      "how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grant through gritty greeted t like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time\n",
      "a few the of door am not going to actually do this and this was all just a ruse to teach a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often don't have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable\n",
      "no one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major from and i brought people together who are used to working with one another\n",
      "and we had him engage in a negotiation and at the end of it there was a winner in there was a loser\n",
      "so he said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential miss stops how many of you think that that's what they actually did they really followed are instructions\n",
      "hey nobody can see where this is going\n",
      "what we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to as we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you me that really early offer and didn't even ask for counter i was amazing or it was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change\n",
      "on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are\n",
      "so often these kinds of interactions the take the form of what i'll call anxious niceness and they involve lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general non specific way\n",
      "but a lot of work actually looks at what's what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of riddles smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering\n",
      "a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of\n",
      "and that anxiety is regulated by being over the top nice to these folks\n",
      "we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronize to and attentive to the how we say a peace than the what we say part someone once teddy we had black and white americans interact with each other in across race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measure the physiology of both partners\n",
      "what this allowed us to do is captured the degree to which people stress those under the skin responses can actually be caught by their partners\n",
      "and what we expect to define is that the black participants will become more synchronize physiologically to those whites the be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that's exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared for the fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol sorry\n",
      "activity indicating some real deep and of under the skin stress response the more those by participants became linked up to them over time\n",
      "and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress in our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always or owner physiology is not always around and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress a good\n",
      "negatively affect your body's\n",
      "no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you\n",
      "need to stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context\n",
      "so imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls me be passed employee recruiter cause you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things are going to put are gonna be like there are real team player they have great energy at work generic things\n",
      "yes there are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves while they must not really know this person at all or even know what this means at worst they think to themselves where they probably have some real opinions they're just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive fee\n",
      "back kinda actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data\n",
      "so i think we have didn't think about what is the solution to this problem is is the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i don't think that's the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i'm in a highly three of them to improve the degree to which we get clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace\n",
      "so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with his niceness culture really there's a bit of a plural ignorance the goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work am what i've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback\n",

      "dominantly learning english and the reason for that is because english control the transform your life in most countries in the world knowledge of english and significantly increase your income potential\n",

      "because of math just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to them become a civil engineer like that's how you make more money whereas with languages if you are a waiter and you'll learn english now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money\n",

      "on the other hand most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone and the trend is that a fraction is only going to increase so we decided that the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone and then we call it duolingo\n",
      "now in order to truly be accessible to everyone rich and poor duolingo used as a freemium model to support itself\n",
      "that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay\n",

      "and now for these people who pay to suspend the turn of the as well they're usually people that well off people in rich countries like the us and canada who are the people who don't pay does as by be usually come from poorer countries like brazil or vietnam or one ammo\n",
      "what i like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically a rich people to pay for the occasion education of everyone so i like that\n",

      "i say it another way what we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that\n",
      "apps like instagram up or mobile games used to keep people engaged in this case we use them to keep you engaged with education\n",

      "it connects people together people find communities and i've heard so many stories of people were found their communities because of the contended a posting now give you an example of\n",

      "just via tick tock one restaurant and in again and again a huge his stories by connecting people together by giving people the window to discover we have forgiven many small businesses and many people your common person a voice that it would never otherwise have and i think that's the power of the platform\n",

      "every law now what we have done again because of the difference in the we were recommended content is that we have given any one any single person with enough talent a speech to be able to be discovered in i think that actually is the single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform and again and again you will hear stories\n",

      "and i think we all can you know what it feels like to be him when he studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there's a lot of equipment involved and but we plug people are tall of these things to measure these under the skin response as be video tape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned not a get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward\n",
      "maybe potentially little bit nice and want you want to think about what was the last awkward interaction the you had a so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments\n",

      "on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are\n",

      "a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of\n",

      "no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you\n",

      "so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with his niceness culture really there's a bit of a plural ignorance the goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work am what i've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback\n",

      "because of math just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to them become a civil engineer like that's how you make more money whereas with languages if you are a waiter and you'll learn english now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money\n",

      "on the other hand most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone and the trend is that a fraction is only going to increase so we decided that the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone and then we call it duolingo\n",
      "now in order to truly be accessible to everyone rich and poor duolingo used as a freemium model to support itself\n",

      "of this distraction it's not that were distracted it's that our brains are over stimulated it's that we crave distraction in the first place our brains love these tiny little nugget serve information and social media an email and these things that we do of course\n",

      "connection or for the feeling of having a special shared experience and i do think it's possible in some circumstances to have fun alone and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings are the activity but the majority of stories of people tell me about their peak fond memories another person is involved and that's true even for interviews\n",

      "you know so much of life drains us but fun fills us up\n",
      "fun also makes us present a lot of us put a lotta work and a trying to be more present you know we do yoga classes we meditate and that is all great or the fact that fun as a flow state means that when we're having fun we simply are present there's no other way for to happen\n",
      "fun also unites us we live in a really polar as worlds and as we whole know there's a lot of very serious problems but when we have fun with people we don't see them as different political parties or nationalities are religions reconnect with them as human beings it's worth noting that that is the first step and been able to work together\n",
      "to solve those problems\n",
      "fun also makes us healthier now being lonely and stressed out as many of us have been for the past two years causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease but when we have fun relaxed and were more socially connected both of which have the opposite effect\n",

      "roasted turkey\n",

      "so go\n",

      "the case that when we're feeling the most anxious uncomfortable socially awkward versions of ourselves when our hearts are pounding and are palms are sweating and me feel a crawling out of our skin\n",
      "are we also the most nice and often generic to the people around us\n",
      "i'm a social psychologists and i've been studying the science of uncomfortable social interactions for over twenty years so everything from new roommate relationships negotiations upward feedback with your boss to doctor patient interactions those moments where you need a break in and say your for the last twenty minutes actually have no idea what you are talking\n",
      "about can we may be rewind to bed and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback\n",
      "second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with her hair doodling then and even tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control are under the skin responses are physiology\n",
      "g r cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate he's types of things that we often don't even really realize that we're feeling and the way i do this is by having people commented lab and interact with each other and a bunch of different settings\n",

      "and i think we all can you know what it feels like to be him when he studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there's a lot of equipment involved and but we plug people are tall of these things to measure these under the skin response as be video tape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned not a get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward\n",
      "maybe potentially little bit nice and want you want to think about what was the last awkward interaction the you had a so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments\n",
      "because in a couple minutes i'm actually gonna randomly call on someone based on your seats to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like\n",
      "so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first twenty seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned the heart rate goes\n",
      "up their blood pressure increases it doesn't take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it and those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who's sitting next to them in an just to get a little bit more distance\n",
      "one of my favorite findings isn't doctor patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more are they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with his patients\n",
      "so let's all return to your awkward moment is everyone have an awkward moment in mind when thinking about when\n",
      "how many of you have i increases in your heart rate maybe palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just the mere thought of being called upon today\n",
      "ag a few of you may be what are seeks be excited about that opportunity not and okay same people could pick\n",
      "how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grant through gritty greeted t like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time\n",
      "a few the of door am not going to actually do this and this was all just a ruse to teach a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often don't have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable\n",
      "no one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major from and i brought people together who are used to working with one another\n",
      "and we had him engage in a negotiation and at the end of it there was a winner in there was a loser\n",
      "so he said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential miss stops how many of you think that that's what they actually did they really followed are instructions\n",
      "hey nobody can see where this is going\n",
      "what we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to as we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you me that really early offer and didn't even ask for counter i was amazing or it was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change\n",
      "on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are\n",
      "so often these kinds of interactions the take the form of what i'll call anxious niceness and they involve lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general non specific way\n",
      "but a lot of work actually looks at what's what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of riddles smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering\n",
      "a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of\n",
      "and that anxiety is regulated by being over the top nice to these folks\n",
      "we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronize to and attentive to the how we say a peace than the what we say part someone once teddy we had black and white americans interact with each other in across race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measure the physiology of both partners\n",
      "what this allowed us to do is captured the degree to which people stress those under the skin responses can actually be caught by their partners\n",
      "and what we expect to define is that the black participants will become more synchronize physiologically to those whites the be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that's exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared for the fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol sorry\n",
      "activity indicating some real deep and of under the skin stress response the more those by participants became linked up to them over time\n",
      "and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress in our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always or owner physiology is not always around and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress a good\n",
      "negatively affect your body's\n",
      "no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you\n",
      "need to stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context\n",
      "so imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls me be passed employee recruiter cause you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things are going to put are gonna be like there are real team player they have great energy at work generic things\n",
      "yes there are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves while they must not really know this person at all or even know what this means at worst they think to themselves where they probably have some real opinions they're just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive fee\n",
      "back kinda actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data\n",

      "but eventually and this may be surprising that people in north america eventually we decided that the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages\n",

      "dominantly learning english and the reason for that is because english control the transform your life in most countries in the world knowledge of english and significantly increase your income potential\n",
      "so this is another reason why we decided to start with foreign languages and is because you can directly make more money if you'll learn another language in particular english and see this is pretty different than many other subjects for example big math\n",
      "because of math just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to them become a civil engineer like that's how you make more money whereas with languages if you are a waiter and you'll learn english now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money\n",
      "so we decided well let's get started teaching languages now we also convinced ourselves that the only way to really reach a lot of people west are using a mobile phone or smartphone in particular\n",
      "the building schools all over the world is simply too expensive\n",
      "on the other hand most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone and the trend is that a fraction is only going to increase so we decided that the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone and then we call it duolingo\n",
      "now in order to truly be accessible to everyone rich and poor duolingo used as a freemium model to support itself\n",
      "that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay\n",
      "but if you don't pay you may have to see an ad at the end of a lesson\n",
      "and if you don't like ads you can also paid to describe the turn of the ads\n",

      "and now for these people who pay to suspend the turn of the as well they're usually people that well off people in rich countries like the us and canada who are the people who don't pay does as by be usually come from poorer countries like brazil or vietnam or one ammo\n",
      "what i like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically a rich people to pay for the occasion education of everyone so i like that\n",
      "it's a great so with smartphones we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people to pay for the whole thing spread however if you're trying to deliver education with a smartphone you run into a humongous problem\n",

      "i say it another way what we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that\n",
      "apps like instagram up or mobile games used to keep people engaged in this case we use them to keep you engaged with education\n",

      "is the case how does technology influence our attention and our ability to focus\n",
      "i want to start with the attention spans that we have this is how we pay attention to the world around us and how much control we have over our focus the research around this particular area is fascinating it turns out that when we to work in front of a computer especially when our\n",

      "and when we have things like slack open as we're doing some work this lowers to the thirty five seconds\n",
      "but the reason that this is the case is not what we might think after looking at the research we think the problem is that our brains are distracted but after looking at the research to this is what i've come to know as a symptom for the deeper problem which runs was were deeply the root cause\n",
      "of this distraction it's not that were distracted it's that our brains are over stimulated it's that we crave distraction in the first place our brains love these tiny little nugget serve information and social media an email and these things that we do of course\n",

      "we have given the everyday person a platform to be discovered if you have talent it is very very easy to get discovered on tick tock and i'll just give you one one example of this the biggest create on tick tock is a guy called copy\n",

      "she you know for the longest time didn't even speak in any of his videos but what he did was in the had talent he was funny he had a good expression he had creativity so we kept posting and today he has one hundred and sixty million followers on our platform so every single day we hear stories like that in a businesses people with talent and i think\n",

      "so this is this is the amazing thing to me like we must have a have grown grown up with say network television for were for decades you've had thousands of brilliant creative people calling in the trenches trying to imagine stuff that will be amazing for an audience and none of them ever remotely came up with anything that know\n",
      "like many of your creators so so the that that these algorithms by just by observing people's behavior what they look like have discovered things that thousands of believe humans never discovered tell me some of the things that it is looking at so obvious things like have some presses like or stay\n",

      "what if you like videos one two three and four and i like videos one two three and five maybe he liked videos one two three and six know what's gonna happen is because we like one two three yeah the same time he's going to be shown four five six and so army and you can thing about this repeated at skill in real time across more than a billion people sp\n",
      "basically what this is his math in of course you know ai and machine learning has allowed this to be done at a very very big skill and what we have seen the result of this is that he learns the interest signals that people exhibit very quickly and shows you content is really relevant for you\n",
      "in a very in in a very quick way not so it's for it's a form of collaborative filtering from what you're saying that yes the theory behind it is the is humans a weird people we don't really know there's them but if if we see that one human is interested with an overlap of someone else chances are you know you can you can make use of the other pieces that are in that overlap\n",
      "humans repertoire to to to feed feed them and they'll be surprised but the reason they like it is because their power also like that it's his pattern recognition based on your interest signals and i think the other thing here is that we don't actually ask you twenty questions on whether you like a piece of content you know what are your interest we don't do that we\n",
      "built that experience organically into the of experience so you're voting with a thumbs in know by watching a video you know by citing it by liking it by sharing it you're basically exhibiting interest signals and what it does and a medically is a take those signals put in a formula and a matches it through pattern recognition that's basically the\n",

      "i mean lots of\n",
      "startups have tried to use these these types of techniques i'm wondering what else played a role early on him and how how big a deal was a the from the get go you optimizing for smartphones so the videos was shot in for correct format and and they and they were short was that it was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered i think we would have first the really tried\n",
      "this scale you know the recommendation algorithm is a very important reason as to why the the perform is so popular occur among so many people are beyond that you mention\n",
      "the format of itself so we talked about the vision of the company which has to have a window to discover in if you sort of just up for the first time you see to it takes up your screen so does the window that we want you can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their lives then you know through this recommendation algorithm we have found it\n",
      "it connects people together people find communities and i've heard so many stories of people were found their communities because of the contended a posting now give you an example of\n",
      "i was in dc recently and i met with a bunch of creators i heard\n",

      "she started posting on this content on tick tock end up you know i saw his content in looks of i was hungry after looking at it's is great you know content in his generators so much interest in his business the last year he mean something like a million dollars in revenue\n",
      "just via tick tock one restaurant and in again and again a huge his stories by connecting people together by giving people the window to discover we have forgiven many small businesses and many people your common person a voice that it would never otherwise have and i think that's the power of the platform\n",
      "so you definitely have identified early just how in our social creatures we need affirmation i'm i've had a story and you can tell me whether true or not the one of the keys to your early lift off was that you want to persuade creators who are trying out tick tock that this was a platform where you know they would get whisper\n",
      "early on when you're trying to grow something in the numbers on that response so you had a brilliant idea of goosing those numbers a bit basically finding ways to give people you know a big a sense of lot more likes more engagement and was actually the case by using a i agent somehow in the in the process is is a brilliant idea is that are the\n",
      "just a myth i would\n",

      "here's some president's having fun together\n",

      "accurate than what's in the dictionary and those three factors are playfulness connection and flow\n",

      "connection or for the feeling of having a special shared experience and i do think it's possible in some circumstances to have fun alone and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings are the activity but the majority of stories of people tell me about their peak fond memories another person is involved and that's true even for interviews\n",
      "it's\n",

      "so for example fun is energizing\n",
      "when people tell me their stories about fun they glow it is like a fire has been lit inside of them in the energy and the warmth of they give off is contagious\n",
      "you know so much of life drains us but fun fills us up\n",
      "fun also makes us present a lot of us put a lotta work and a trying to be more present you know we do yoga classes we meditate and that is all great or the fact that fun as a flow state means that when we're having fun we simply are present there's no other way for to happen\n",
      "fun also unites us we live in a really polar as worlds and as we whole know there's a lot of very serious problems but when we have fun with people we don't see them as different political parties or nationalities are religions reconnect with them as human beings it's worth noting that that is the first step and been able to work together\n",
      "to solve those problems\n",
      "fun also makes us healthier now being lonely and stressed out as many of us have been for the past two years causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease but when we have fun relaxed and were more socially connected both of which have the opposite effect\n",
      "so kind of blows my mind every time i think about it this way but having fun is a health intervention\n",

      "roasted turkey\n",

      "those are not good suggestions\n",
      "instead the most effective thing you can do to have more fun is to focus on it's ingredients are which i mean do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness connection and flow so here's my ideas for how to do so so to star with reduced distractions and order to increase flow anything that distracts you is going to kick you out to flow and prevent you from having\n",

      "are we also the most nice and often generic to the people around us\n",
      "i'm a social psychologists and i've been studying the science of uncomfortable social interactions for over twenty years so everything from new roommate relationships negotiations upward feedback with your boss to doctor patient interactions those moments where you need a break in and say your for the last twenty minutes actually have no idea what you are talking\n",
      "about can we may be rewind to bed and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback\n",
      "second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with her hair doodling then and even tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control are under the skin responses are physiology\n",
      "g r cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate he's types of things that we often don't even really realize that we're feeling and the way i do this is by having people commented lab and interact with each other and a bunch of different settings\n",

      "and i think we all can you know what it feels like to be him when he studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there's a lot of equipment involved and but we plug people are tall of these things to measure these under the skin response as be video tape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned not a get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward\n",
      "maybe potentially little bit nice and want you want to think about what was the last awkward interaction the you had a so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments\n",
      "because in a couple minutes i'm actually gonna randomly call on someone based on your seats to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like\n",
      "so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first twenty seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned the heart rate goes\n",
      "up their blood pressure increases it doesn't take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it and those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who's sitting next to them in an just to get a little bit more distance\n",
      "one of my favorite findings isn't doctor patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more are they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with his patients\n",
      "so let's all return to your awkward moment is everyone have an awkward moment in mind when thinking about when\n",
      "how many of you have i increases in your heart rate maybe palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just the mere thought of being called upon today\n",
      "ag a few of you may be what are seeks be excited about that opportunity not and okay same people could pick\n",
      "how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grant through gritty greeted t like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time\n",
      "a few the of door am not going to actually do this and this was all just a ruse to teach a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often don't have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable\n",
      "no one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major from and i brought people together who are used to working with one another\n",
      "and we had him engage in a negotiation and at the end of it there was a winner in there was a loser\n",
      "so he said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential miss stops how many of you think that that's what they actually did they really followed are instructions\n",
      "hey nobody can see where this is going\n",
      "what we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to as we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you me that really early offer and didn't even ask for counter i was amazing or it was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change\n",
      "on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are\n",
      "so often these kinds of interactions the take the form of what i'll call anxious niceness and they involve lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general non specific way\n",
      "but a lot of work actually looks at what's what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of riddles smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering\n",
      "a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of\n",
      "and that anxiety is regulated by being over the top nice to these folks\n",
      "we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronize to and attentive to the how we say a peace than the what we say part someone once teddy we had black and white americans interact with each other in across race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measure the physiology of both partners\n",
      "what this allowed us to do is captured the degree to which people stress those under the skin responses can actually be caught by their partners\n",
      "and what we expect to define is that the black participants will become more synchronize physiologically to those whites the be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that's exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared for the fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol sorry\n",
      "activity indicating some real deep and of under the skin stress response the more those by participants became linked up to them over time\n",
      "and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress in our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always or owner physiology is not always around and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress a good\n",
      "negatively affect your body's\n",
      "no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you\n",
      "need to stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context\n",
      "so imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls me be passed employee recruiter cause you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things are going to put are gonna be like there are real team player they have great energy at work generic things\n",
      "yes there are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves while they must not really know this person at all or even know what this means at worst they think to themselves where they probably have some real opinions they're just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive fee\n",
      "back kinda actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data\n",
      "so i think we have didn't think about what is the solution to this problem is is the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i don't think that's the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i'm in a highly three of them to improve the degree to which we get clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace\n",
      "so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with his niceness culture really there's a bit of a plural ignorance the goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work am what i've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback\n",

      "but eventually and this may be surprising that people in north america eventually we decided that the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages\n",
      "and let me tell you why is a number of reasons i'm one of them is that there's a huge audience for it is a two billion people in the world earning a foreign language of in school and outside of schools most of these people went away i learning english about eighty percent of them are learning english and this weird map i hear all the countries in green a countries in which people are pretty\n",
      "dominantly learning english and the reason for that is because english control the transform your life in most countries in the world knowledge of english and significantly increase your income potential\n",
      "so this is another reason why we decided to start with foreign languages and is because you can directly make more money if you'll learn another language in particular english and see this is pretty different than many other subjects for example big math\n",
      "because of math just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to them become a civil engineer like that's how you make more money whereas with languages if you are a waiter and you'll learn english now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money\n",
      "so we decided well let's get started teaching languages now we also convinced ourselves that the only way to really reach a lot of people west are using a mobile phone or smartphone in particular\n",
      "the building schools all over the world is simply too expensive\n",
      "on the other hand most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone and the trend is that a fraction is only going to increase so we decided that the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone and then we call it duolingo\n",
      "now in order to truly be accessible to everyone rich and poor duolingo used as a freemium model to support itself\n",
      "that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay\n",
      "but if you don't pay you may have to see an ad at the end of a lesson\n",
      "and if you don't like ads you can also paid to describe the turn of the ads\n",
      "and it turns out that the vast majority of the revenue for duolingo comes from people to pay described to turn of the ass\n",
      "and now for these people who pay to suspend the turn of the as well they're usually people that well off people in rich countries like the us and canada who are the people who don't pay does as by be usually come from poorer countries like brazil or vietnam or one ammo\n",
      "what i like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically a rich people to pay for the occasion education of everyone so i like that\n",
      "it's a great so with smartphones we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people to pay for the whole thing spread however if you're trying to deliver education with a smartphone you run into a humongous problem\n",

      "seat delivering education of our smartphone is like hoping that people will eat your broccoli or right next to it you put the most delicious dessert ever made\n",
      "if if you really want to deliver education to everyone not only do you have to make it accessible but also you have to make it so that people want to actually learn\n",
      "and we do willing we've been able to do this and at the highest level the where we've done this is by making the broccoli there's like desert\n",
      "i say it another way what we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that\n",
      "apps like instagram up or mobile games used to keep people engaged in this case we use them to keep you engaged with education\n",
      "and even some examples of these techniques one of the most powerful ones is the notion of a streak what a streak is is is just a counter measures a number of days that you've used the proud of consecutive you just think that number you put a very prominently in your product and then people come back every day and the reason people come back every day is because\n",

      "that basically choose this when to send the notification and also what to say in his notification to maximize the probability that people come back\n",
      "now interestingly even after all the sophistication it turns out that the algorithm for choosing what i'm to send your notification is pretty simple\n",

      "but the good news is that and by the way to the reason i don't believe that is because ultimately you have to teach people something and it's hard to compete with like cats and celebrities i'm but the good news is the i don't think you have to so here's the thing when you're learning something you get meaning out of it whereas when you're scrolling for two hours and instagram a lot of times afterwards if\n",
      "you're lucky you just wasted your time so i think it's actually okay if your educational product is only eighty or ninety percent as engaging or something like ticked off because the other ten or twenty percent will be provided by people's internal motivational though of course not much more than that\n",

      "meaningful you can use the same techniques that apps like social media use to get people to do it and even if you're not as engaging as those apps are you can still get hundreds of millions of people to use your product in the case of duolingo for example there are more people learning languages on duolingo in the united states and there are people learning languages across all us high school\n",

      "but the reason that this is the case is not what we might think after looking at the research we think the problem is that our brains are distracted but after looking at the research to this is what i've come to know as a symptom for the deeper problem which runs was were deeply the root cause\n",
      "of this distraction it's not that were distracted it's that our brains are over stimulated it's that we crave distraction in the first place our brains love these tiny little nugget serve information and social media an email and these things that we do of course\n",

      "search you know there was an app that was built for people who wanted to search things that was eaten took the saudis more easily the serve found and then in the era of social graphs it was about connecting people enough followers not what we have done is that we are based on ah machine learning algorithms were showing people what they like and what this means is\n",
      "we have given the everyday person a platform to be discovered if you have talent it is very very easy to get discovered on tick tock and i'll just give you one one example of this the biggest create on tick tock is a guy called copy\n",

      "she you know for the longest time didn't even speak in any of his videos but what he did was in the had talent he was funny he had a good expression he had creativity so we kept posting and today he has one hundred and sixty million followers on our platform so every single day we hear stories like that in a businesses people with talent and i think\n",

      "so this is this is the amazing thing to me like we must have a have grown grown up with say network television for were for decades you've had thousands of brilliant creative people calling in the trenches trying to imagine stuff that will be amazing for an audience and none of them ever remotely came up with anything that know\n",
      "like many of your creators so so the that that these algorithms by just by observing people's behavior what they look like have discovered things that thousands of believe humans never discovered tell me some of the things that it is looking at so obvious things like have some presses like or stay\n",

      "what if you like videos one two three and four and i like videos one two three and five maybe he liked videos one two three and six know what's gonna happen is because we like one two three yeah the same time he's going to be shown four five six and so army and you can thing about this repeated at skill in real time across more than a billion people sp\n",
      "basically what this is his math in of course you know ai and machine learning has allowed this to be done at a very very big skill and what we have seen the result of this is that he learns the interest signals that people exhibit very quickly and shows you content is really relevant for you\n",
      "in a very in in a very quick way not so it's for it's a form of collaborative filtering from what you're saying that yes the theory behind it is the is humans a weird people we don't really know there's them but if if we see that one human is interested with an overlap of someone else chances are you know you can you can make use of the other pieces that are in that overlap\n",
      "humans repertoire to to to feed feed them and they'll be surprised but the reason they like it is because their power also like that it's his pattern recognition based on your interest signals and i think the other thing here is that we don't actually ask you twenty questions on whether you like a piece of content you know what are your interest we don't do that we\n",
      "built that experience organically into the of experience so you're voting with a thumbs in know by watching a video you know by citing it by liking it by sharing it you're basically exhibiting interest signals and what it does and a medically is a take those signals put in a formula and a matches it through pattern recognition that's basically the\n",

      "i mean lots of\n",
      "startups have tried to use these these types of techniques i'm wondering what else played a role early on him and how how big a deal was a the from the get go you optimizing for smartphones so the videos was shot in for correct format and and they and they were short was that it was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered i think we would have first the really tried\n",
      "this scale you know the recommendation algorithm is a very important reason as to why the the perform is so popular occur among so many people are beyond that you mention\n",
      "the format of itself so we talked about the vision of the company which has to have a window to discover in if you sort of just up for the first time you see to it takes up your screen so does the window that we want you can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their lives then you know through this recommendation algorithm we have found it\n",
      "it connects people together people find communities and i've heard so many stories of people were found their communities because of the contended a posting now give you an example of\n",
      "i was in dc recently and i met with a bunch of creators i heard\n",
      "and so one of them are sitting next to me at a dinner his name is samuel he was a restaurant in phoenix arizona and is a taco restaurant he told me he's never done this before first you know venture\n",
      "she started posting on this content on tick tock end up you know i saw his content in looks of i was hungry after looking at it's is great you know content in his generators so much interest in his business the last year he mean something like a million dollars in revenue\n",
      "just via tick tock one restaurant and in again and again a huge his stories by connecting people together by giving people the window to discover we have forgiven many small businesses and many people your common person a voice that it would never otherwise have and i think that's the power of the platform\n",
      "so you definitely have identified early just how in our social creatures we need affirmation i'm i've had a story and you can tell me whether true or not the one of the keys to your early lift off was that you want to persuade creators who are trying out tick tock that this was a platform where you know they would get whisper\n",
      "early on when you're trying to grow something in the numbers on that response so you had a brilliant idea of goosing those numbers a bit basically finding ways to give people you know a big a sense of lot more likes more engagement and was actually the case by using a i agent somehow in the in the process is is a brilliant idea is that are the\n",
      "just a myth i would\n",
      "i would i would describe it in a different way so the other platforms to exist they don't with before tick tock in if you think about this platforms you sort of have to be famous already in order to go followers because the we is build is that people come and follow people and if we don't if you aren't really famous the chances that you get discovered a very\n",
      "every law now what we have done again because of the difference in the we were recommended content is that we have given any one any single person with enough talent a speech to be able to be discovered in i think that actually is the single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform and again and again you will hear stories\n",
      "from people who use the platform or post regularly on it that if the have something you want to see the performed just them the chance and the stage to connect with the audience in a way that i think no other products in the past as ever offered them\n",
      "so i'm i'm just trying to play back what what use what you said they you said you were describing their differ way what i what i said is is it that in the case that like to give someone a decent chance someone who's brilliant but doesn't come with any follow as initially that you you have you got some technique to identify talent and that you will you will almost encourage them you will you will give them some guy\n",
      "and of from artificially increase the number of followers were like so whatever that they have so the others are encouraged to go wow there's something there and so forth like it's this idea of critical mass that kind of every entrepreneur every party planner kind of those about of the know this is the hot place in town everyone calm and that that is how you actually game critical mass we we wanted\n",
      "sure that every person who posts a video is given and an equal chance to be able to have some audience to begin with but this idea that you are the media alluding to that we can get people to like something it doesn't really work like that you don't then you get could you get a i agents to like something for you see the network way\n",
      "with extra and for could kind of get you know give give someone early encouragement ultimately what the machine does is he recognizes people's interests so if you post something that's not interesting though a lot of people even if you gave it a lot of exposure you're not going to get of morality that you what whereas come so is is a lot of you know there's no\n",

      "and want to give you all some suggestions for things you can do starting right now to experience it's power for yourself\n",
      "so the first thing we need to start with i am is the fact that fun is a feeling and it's not an activity and it's important because a lotta times when i ask people what's fun though respond with a list of activities that they enjoyed you know the same dancing is fun or scheme as finer i don't know pickle ball is fine\n",
      "everyone seems to think that pickle ball is fun\n",

      "and then on the flipside we've had experiences were something that doesn't seem like would be fun at all and the feeling ridiculously fun is an element of serendipity it when people do have fun when they experienced this feeling it's actually very easy to recognize because people who are having fun look like they're being illuminated from within\n",
      "so for example here's me and my husband having fun together\n",
      "here's some president's having fun together\n",
      "here's archbishop desmond tutu and the dalai lama having fun together\n",
      "actually those to seem like they were very often even constantly\n",

      "it's radiant and fact when i asked my daughter when she was about five years old what color fun would be she said sunshine\n",
      "so what is the sunshine you know what is this feeling that we call fun but when people tell me their stories about fun it's really interesting because the details are all different and often quite mundane but the energy running through them as the same and there are three factors that are consistently present to the point that i believe they constitute a new definition one that is a lot more\n",
      "accurate than what's in the dictionary and those three factors are playfulness connection and flow\n",
      "so by playfulness i do not mean you have to play games or god forbid make believe i just me having a light hearted attitude of doing things for the sake of doing them and not carrying too much about the outcome letting go of perfectionism when we have fun or guard is down and we're not taking ourselves too seriously\n",
      "connection or for the feeling of having a special shared experience and i do think it's possible in some circumstances to have fun alone and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings are the activity but the majority of stories of people tell me about their peak fond memories another person is involved and that's true even for interviews\n",
      "it's\n",
      "and then flow is the state where we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time you can think about an athlete little the game or like a musician plane a piece of music it's when we're in the zone\n",
      "is possible to be in flow and not have fun like if you're arguing but you cannot have fun if you're not in flow\n",
      "so playful is cash inflow all feel great on their own but when we experience all three at once something magical happens we have fun\n",
      "and that doesn't just feel good it is good for us and fact fund us so many amazingly good things for us that i personally believe that fun is not just the result of human thriving it's a cause\n",
      "so for example fun is energizing\n",
      "when people tell me their stories about fun they glow it is like a fire has been lit inside of them in the energy and the warmth of they give off is contagious\n",
      "you know so much of life drains us but fun fills us up\n",
      "fun also makes us present a lot of us put a lotta work and a trying to be more present you know we do yoga classes we meditate and that is all great or the fact that fun as a flow state means that when we're having fun we simply are present there's no other way for to happen\n",
      "fun also unites us we live in a really polar as worlds and as we whole know there's a lot of very serious problems but when we have fun with people we don't see them as different political parties or nationalities are religions reconnect with them as human beings it's worth noting that that is the first step and been able to work together\n",
      "to solve those problems\n",
      "fun also makes us healthier now being lonely and stressed out as many of us have been for the past two years causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease but when we have fun relaxed and were more socially connected both of which have the opposite effect\n",
      "so kind of blows my mind every time i think about it this way but having fun is a health intervention\n",
      "and then lastly fun is joyful in it we all so desperately want to be happy we read books about happiness we download apps buy happiness but when we are in a moment of having fun we are happy\n",
      "so makes me think that perhaps the secret to long term happiness is just to have more everyday moments of fun\n",
      "so how do we do that how do we have more fun well to start with do not take the suggestions you'll find a magazine articles about how to have more fun so i'll i looked up some of these myself when i found suggestions that include are not is up\n",
      "roasted turkey\n",
      "put together an altar to loved ones who have passed\n",
      "watch a documentary about climates\n",
      "and my personal favorite a during your table with gourds\n",
      "so go\n",
      "those are not good suggestions\n",
      "instead the most effective thing you can do to have more fun is to focus on it's ingredients are which i mean do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness connection and flow so here's my ideas for how to do so so to star with reduced distractions and order to increase flow anything that distracts you is going to kick you out to flow and prevent you from having\n",
      "fun\n",
      "and what's the number one source of distraction for most of us these days\n",
      "oh thank you\n",
      "a for target but yes your phones\n",
      "now i wrote a book called how to break up with your phone so i have strong feelings about this but i can guarantee you that you're not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone so today i want to challenge you to keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible so the you can take me up my second suggestion which is to increase connection by interacting more with other human being\n",
      "in real life\n",
      "now i know that one of the main reasons were causally on our phones is specifically to avoid having to spend time and interact with other human beings in real life\n",

      "are we also the most nice and often generic to the people around us\n",
      "i'm a social psychologists and i've been studying the science of uncomfortable social interactions for over twenty years so everything from new roommate relationships negotiations upward feedback with your boss to doctor patient interactions those moments where you need a break in and say your for the last twenty minutes actually have no idea what you are talking\n",
      "about can we may be rewind to bed and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback\n",
      "second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with her hair doodling then and even tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control are under the skin responses are physiology\n",
      "g r cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate he's types of things that we often don't even really realize that we're feeling and the way i do this is by having people commented lab and interact with each other and a bunch of different settings\n",
      "and i have them negotiate with each other a had them get acquainted with each other and often it's the case the in these interactions people are required to give some form of feedback to their partner tell them honestly whether thinking or feeling common with an offer for negotiation tell them what they could have done better next time\n",
      "and i think we all can you know what it feels like to be him when he studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there's a lot of equipment involved and but we plug people are tall of these things to measure these under the skin response as be video tape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned not a get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward\n",
      "maybe potentially little bit nice and want you want to think about what was the last awkward interaction the you had a so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments\n",
      "because in a couple minutes i'm actually gonna randomly call on someone based on your seats to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like\n",
      "so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first twenty seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned the heart rate goes\n",
      "up their blood pressure increases it doesn't take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it and those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who's sitting next to them in an just to get a little bit more distance\n",
      "one of my favorite findings isn't doctor patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more are they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with his patients\n",
      "so let's all return to your awkward moment is everyone have an awkward moment in mind when thinking about when\n",
      "how many of you have i increases in your heart rate maybe palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just the mere thought of being called upon today\n",
      "ag a few of you may be what are seeks be excited about that opportunity not and okay same people could pick\n",
      "how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grant through gritty greeted t like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time\n",
      "a few the of door am not going to actually do this and this was all just a ruse to teach a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often don't have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable\n",
      "no one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major from and i brought people together who are used to working with one another\n",
      "and we had him engage in a negotiation and at the end of it there was a winner in there was a loser\n",
      "so he said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential miss stops how many of you think that that's what they actually did they really followed are instructions\n",
      "hey nobody can see where this is going\n",
      "what we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to as we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you me that really early offer and didn't even ask for counter i was amazing or it was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change\n",
      "on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are\n",
      "so often these kinds of interactions the take the form of what i'll call anxious niceness and they involve lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general non specific way\n",
      "but a lot of work actually looks at what's what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of riddles smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering\n",
      "a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of\n",
      "and that anxiety is regulated by being over the top nice to these folks\n",
      "we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronize to and attentive to the how we say a peace than the what we say part someone once teddy we had black and white americans interact with each other in across race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measure the physiology of both partners\n",
      "what this allowed us to do is captured the degree to which people stress those under the skin responses can actually be caught by their partners\n",
      "and what we expect to define is that the black participants will become more synchronize physiologically to those whites the be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that's exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared for the fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol sorry\n",
      "activity indicating some real deep and of under the skin stress response the more those by participants became linked up to them over time\n",
      "and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress in our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always or owner physiology is not always around and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress a good\n",
      "negatively affect your body's\n",
      "no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you\n",
      "need to stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context\n",
      "so imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls me be passed employee recruiter cause you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things are going to put are gonna be like there are real team player they have great energy at work generic things\n",
      "yes there are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves while they must not really know this person at all or even know what this means at worst they think to themselves where they probably have some real opinions they're just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive fee\n",
      "back kinda actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data\n",
      "so i think we have didn't think about what is the solution to this problem is is the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i don't think that's the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i'm in a highly three of them to improve the degree to which we get clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace\n",
      "so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with his niceness culture really there's a bit of a plural ignorance the goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work am what i've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback\n",
